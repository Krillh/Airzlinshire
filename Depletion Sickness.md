Depletion Sickness (Majik Depletion Sickness) is when someone uses all or nearly all their majik stores. Common symptoms include:
- Loss of consciousness
- Extreme lack of energy / tiredness
- Fatigue
- Lowered body temperature

When someone has depletion sickness, a good long rest is usually enough to fully recover. Though, it has been found that exposure to deep ice from Elestal can hugely expedite the recovery timeline.
