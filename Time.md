In Airzlinshire, one year is roughly the same as on Earth. It's exactly 365 days long, but the days are not quite the same length.

The second is the same, and that will be the basis of the conversions.

This is a table for the unit conversions.

Most time units are quite similar to Earth counterparts (see rightmost column), but are a tad longer. The units are made to fit into a [[Numbers|binary counting system]]. All these values were constructed to be perfectly in line with the rotations and revolutions of the planet around their star. Because their sky measurement technology is not quite as precise as it could be, there's a team of powerful majik users who's job it is to alter the trajectory of the planet to fit into the time system.

The people of Airzlinshire experience a year the same as we do, with similar goals and prospects. They experience the months as decent blocks of time, and
