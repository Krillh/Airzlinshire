Moral Development (lawrence kohlberg)

- **Infant (0-2 years) - Sensorimotor Stage:**
    
    - Recognizing familiar faces 
    - Object permanence (understanding an object still exists even when hidden) 
    - Imitating actions 
    - Simple cause-and-effect understanding
- **Early Childhood (2-7 years) - Preoperational Stage:**
    
    - Symbolic play (pretend play) 
    - Language development 
    - Egocentrism (difficulty seeing other perspectives) 
    - Classification (grouping objects by similar features) 
    
- **Middle Childhood (7-11 years) - Concrete Operational Stage:**
    
    - Conservation (understanding quantity remains constant despite changes in appearance) 
    - Seriation (ordering objects by size) 
    - Logical reasoning with concrete situations 
    - Understanding of simple rules and concepts 
    
- **Adolescence (12+ years) - Formal Operational Stage:**
    
    - Abstract reasoning 
    - Hypothetical thinking 
    - Complex problem-solving 
    - Understanding of multiple perspectives 
    

Important Points to Remember:

- These are general guidelines, and individual development can vary.
- Milestones are not always achieved in a strict order.
- Early intervention can be crucial for addressing developmental delays.

## Notes

- 0-2 years - all learning is tactile. sucking, tasting, seeing actions, object permanence. learns causality (that you can cause things to happen)
