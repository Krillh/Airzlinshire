#Monus #River #Location 

The Great Monus River is a river that runs through the whole of [[Monus Kingdom|Monus]]. It is extremely large, having a flow rate of 128,000 cubic meters per second. The river is 1,027 meters wide at it's widest. The rivers were created by the formation of the Monus Mountains
# River Sections
The river has 3 sections. Technically, there are 3 rivers in [[Monus Kingdom|Monus]], the Lower Monus River, the North Upper Monus River, and the East Upper Monus River. The two upper rivers merge into the lower river. Accordingly, the rivers are named after the regions they belong to: [[Lower Monus]], [[Upper Monus#North Upper Monus|North Upper Monus]], and [[Upper Monus#East Upper Monus|East Upper Monus]].
## The North River
The north river is the smallest of the three with a flow rate of 43,000 cubic meters per second. It is also the fastest flowing on average at nearly 5.2 meters per second. That is dangerously fast, and people do occasionally find themselves pulled downstream.
## The East River
The east river is the larger of the two upper rivers with a flow rate of 76,000 cubic meters per second. It flows at about 2.6 meters per second. This is faster than most people can swim, but not inescapable.
## The Lower River
The lower river is the largest as it is the combination of the two upper rivers. It has a flow rate of 128,000 cubic meters per second and a speed of 
### Lower Monus River Expansion
At some point, the lower river was dug to decrease it's width. This was largely to reclaim land as it was extremely wide before. The project took almost 2 years, but it exceeded expectations. The river was deepened and banks were sloped up. This made it so the river took up less space, and so that it would have more capacity in case of flood.
