Each principal (mono-syllabic) root, other than /h-/ roots, get's it's own full-width character. There are a few reoccurring radicals, like /pe/, the symbol for "person". In fact, that is one of the most common radicals along with half on /pne/, meaning "thing", and an open version of /pne/ to represent a container. Nearly all principal root characters are vaguely ideograms, representing some idea by attempting to visualize it.

These characters only represent the root, however, and most roots are not free morphemes, but bound ones. They need a suffix to be used as a word. Each of these suffixes are added to a principal morpheme by adding a diacritic marker. However, even roots that can be used as free morphemes cannot be written without a diacritic, there is a silent diacritic used for marking the use of a free morpheme.

As hinted to before, /h/ roots are a special case. Each mono-syllabic /h/ root has it's own character and does not use a diacritic. These are actually phonetic characters, built out of 3 parts each, one for the /h/ at the beginning, one for the
