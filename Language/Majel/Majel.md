#Majel


Majel is a constructed language in the world of [[Airzlinshire]], made for it's simple writing and speaking. It quickly became the trade language of the world.

> Meta talk about various inspirations:
> The script was inspired a lot by Korean scripts, at least in concept. They also use an abugida, though it is a bit more complicated. The idea of open syllables was from Japanese, and the idea of root words from the Chinese family of languages. The concept of suffixes is partially inspired from PIE (Proto-Indo-European).

# History

Majel was invented towards the start of the Era of Celestial Accord, and was the primary driver for [[The Globalization Boom]]. Because of it's simplicity, both in speaking and writing. Majel quickly took on popularity among illiterate farmers in the [[Gmir River Valley]]. Having a consistent 

## Motivators For Spread

One of the largest motivators for farmers to learn this language was to enable them to conduct international trade without a 3rd party. There were 3 primary standard trading practices for foodstuffs, the first is a basic distributer model where distributers handle all the logistics, the second model is a trade agreement model where 2 parties will create a reoccurring trade, and the third model is order based where purchasers will put out an order and some farmer will fulfill some or all of it. The problem is that all of these systems go through merchants. This is because farmers did not have access to education to learn other languages, nor did they have the time or money to make large trips away from home to sell their products. Because all trade went through merchants, and with the anonymity of

Vowels (with Romanized symbols in parenthesis):

|           | Front | Mid | Back |

# Script

The main script for Majel is simply called the Majel Script. It is a phonetic abugida. Each character is made up of 2 parts, the top part (the consonant) and the bottom (the vowel). No other consonant part is needed as all syllables in Majel are either CV or CVV (one consonant then one or two vowels).
## Voiced / Unvoiced Change

With consonants that have both the voiced and unvoiced variant present in the phonology, the voiced variant of the consonant has a vertical stroke on the left side of the character. The stroke falls through the vowel section of the character, making the consonant surround the left side of the vowel along with whatever other sides are covered by the unvoiced consonant.
# Parts of Speech

There are 5 parts of speech in Majel: nouns, adjectives, verbs, prepositions, and particles. Nouns are just that, people, places, things, or ideas. Pronouns are grouped in with nouns as they act the same. Adjectives are describing words, for either a noun or verb. Verbs are action words, they describe what the subject is doing. Prepositions were derivative of SR particles and relate a noun to an action. You can eat food, and you can do that **on** the beach. Particles are much more complicated, there being multiple types of particles. All of them give context to sentences in different ways. Sentence relation (SR) particles can be used to describe how one sentence is related to the next. Mood marking (MM) particles mark the grammatical mood of the verb in a clause.
## Prepositions

All verbs in Majel take only a direct object. To extend the object clause, you can add a preposition and a another verb or noun (I eat food __with__ you). This comes from a simplification from older Majel where the SR particle would be placed between sentences, forming ".I eat food. with. you." (mi povo po. ;joi;. ti. -> mi povo po joi ti.). To add more of these clause extensions, simply add more prepositions separating them.
# Root Words

With the 16 main consonants (the first 16) and 5 vowels, you can make 80 syllables of the CV format. These syllables are called the "mono root words", or simply, "mono roots". They are also called group 1 roots. Each one has a definition, and all words are derived in one way or another from these root words, except the words themselves of course.
## Group 2 Roots

Group 2 roots are derived from group 1 roots by means of vowel movement. Each mono root has 1 vowel, and each vowel has 2 ways it can be transformed into a group 2 root. The vowel movement rules describe which diphthongs are allowed to be derived from which vowels.
- a -> ia, ua
- i -> ai, ei
- u -> au, iu
- e -> ie, ue
- o -> oi, ou

The definitions of group 2 roots are usually fairly close to that of the mono root it came from.

## Group 3 Roots

Group 3 roots can be derived from either group 1 or 2 roots. Usually they differ by meaning more than group 2 to group 1 roots. They are made by adding 'xi', 'xe', or 'xo' to the end of a root. They are all 2 syllables each.
# Suffixes & Composite Words

Composite words are made by putting together multiple roots to make another word. They follow similar rules as making compound words in English. The thing goes last, and any words that describe it go before it. An example: "fireplace" fire place, not place (of) fire.

Suffixes are used to turn a word from a noun into another part of speech (except particles). There are multiple suffixes, like -rai that means "similar to / like". It turns a word into an adjective that describes something as similar to the root of the adjective.

Though there are a few suffixes that are used commonly, but artistically, any word can be used as a suffix, as long as it makes sense.
# Syntax

## SVO

Majel follows a "Subject Verb Object" (SVO) word ordering. This means that the subject comes before the verb, then the object. Here's an example in English:
$$\underbrace{\text{Mark}}_{\text{subject}}\;\underbrace{\text{wants}}_{verb}\;\text{a }\underbrace{\text{pear}}_{\text{object}}.$$
The direct object always goes first since indirect objects always have a preposition before them. This is the same as [[Old Gvar#SVO|Old Gvar]].

## Clauses

In Majel, clauses all have a subject, verb, and object. Any of them can be implicit or explicit as long as at least one is explicit (or else there would be no sentence).

### Explicit and Implicit Clause Parts

In many circumstances, it is common for a part of a clause to be omitted. This happens when the part is clear from context. This can be because it is the same as the previous clause, or some other context makes it obvious.
