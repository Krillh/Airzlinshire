This is the translated diary of one person who seemed to be the first to discover bronze.

```
Today, the world revealed a new secret, a gift from the gods, a discovery like no other. I began the day like any other, with the familiar task of smelting fire stone to craft a knife. The hearth was glowing, and the heat was as intense as always. But as I worked, something strange happened. The copper, our trusted fire stone, began to change. I noticed a different shine, a distinct hue that I had never seen before.

In my excitement, I extracted the glowing mass from the fire. The color was different—a rich, golden-brown tint, unlike the reddish glow of fire stone. The metal was smoother, almost shimmering in the light. It was... beautiful.

I decided to forge it, to see what this new metal could do. To my astonishment, it was easier to work than copper. It molded effortlessly under my hammer, bending to my will with remarkable ease. It was almost as if the metal had a life of its own, eager to take shape. I have decided to call it "workable metal," for it truly is a gift to a smith's hands.

As I worked, I realized that this new metal was stronger too. It felt more solid, more durable. The knife I fashioned from it held its edge far better than any I had made from fire stone. The sensation of holding this new creation was exhilarating—like holding the future in my hands.

I am overwhelmed with curiosity and excitement. What other wonders could be unlocked with this discovery? How will it change our ways, our tools, our lives? The world feels different now, filled with new possibilities. Tonight, I shall dream of what tomorrow will bring.
