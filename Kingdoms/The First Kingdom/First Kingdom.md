The First Kingdom was, as the name implies, the first appearance of a kingdom in Airzlinshire history.
## Formation
Toward the end of the [[Eras of History#The Copper Era|Copper Era]], cities were expanding and some farmers' land was bumping into each other. Once city, being surrounded on all sides, immediately realized that they would not be able to expand if this continued. Their leader held a meeting with the leaders of all the other cities to discuss a contract. This contract outlined rules for sharing resources and helping each other, essentially combining the cities into one kingdom. All the other cities signed the contract with little hesitation. When choosing a capital, the city that proposed the contract was the natural choice, and thus their leader became the leader of the whole kingdom.
