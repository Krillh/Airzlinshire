The Majik Era is marked by the fall of the [[First Kingdom]] in the [[First Kingdom Civil War]]. The recent discovery of [[Majik]] sparked a new direction of growth for society. Public majik schools and majik research institutes were established to develop majik use. The primary focus was on military applications since all the cities were warring with each other for control of land and mining resources (namely iron in the [[Windy Cliffs]] but also many pit mines for copper, silver, and gold).

The majik schools taught all civilians to use majik for combat, and laws about academy attendance and drafting were put into place in nearly all cities. Just about every person was either a farmer, miner, researcher, noble or leader, soldier, or student. The demand for artisans was low at the start of the Majik Era; every city was geared for war. Farmers usually doubled as builders and miners doubled as craftsmen.

New breakthroughs in majik combat were being made nearly every month, and the [[Windy Cliffs]] changed hands.

## Discoveries

1. The first discovery was [[Light Majik]]. It was the element that the soldiers of [[Rion City]] used to burn [[Center City]] to the ground. Only basic usage was discovered at the time like intensifying fires or making small objects glow.
2. The discovery of [[Dark Majik]] came soon after the [[First Kingdom Civil War]] ended, and may have been discovered by one of the [[Rion City]] soldiers when burning down [[Center City]].
