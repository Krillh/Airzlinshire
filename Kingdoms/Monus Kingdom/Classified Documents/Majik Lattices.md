DEPARTMENTS: MAJIK LATTICE RESEARCH

Majik Lattices are structures made of Majik Threads. They are harnessed to cause Majik Manipulation in tomes.

When a Thread is agitated by Majik energy, it will produce Majik Manipulations. The element of, shape, orientation of the Thread, along with how it is connected to other Threads in the Lattice determine the type and location of the Majik Manipulation it causes. The Royal Order of the Monus Tome Monks are those who hold the secrets of how to form and manipulate Majik Lattices.

The process of weaving Majik Threads into Lattices is a skill that takes many years of difficult training to be able to do.

To make a Tome, you must start with an object to contain the Lattice. The more Majik Capacity the object has, the easier it is to work with. Choosing the right object is very important. The Monetary will provide a variety of objects to work, but one's ability to minimize the cost of a Tome is judged, so it is in your best interest to choose one that has the minimal capacity for the order you are working on. It is also important to consider that as the capacity of the object approaches the theoretical minimum for an order, the room for error will decreases rapidly. This means that the skill to complete the order without breaking the object is increased and the time it takes is also increased. One must balance the time it takes and the cost of the object when deciding. Once decided, you will take the object to a weaving room. Each monk is assigned their own personal weaving room. You will then begin the process of weaving. One thread at a time, conjured from one's Majik. It takes incredible focus and skill to weave the threads together in a meaningful way, and even more skill to predict what the resulting Majik Manipulation will be. Simple spells may have only 8 Threads making up the Lattice, but there can be hundreds of them in the most powerful and complicated Lattices.
