## Overview
There are 6 species of person. Giants, Warriors, Natrels, Survivors, Humans, and Scientificals / Intellectuals.

### Giants
Giants are a fairly docile species of person. They are quite large reaching around 3.5 meters (11.5  feet) tall and also live around 100 years. Giants physically have less brain capacity than a human but are not dumb. Their brain capacity is on par with an average 12 year old human. Giants are known for their friendly nature but sometimes experience discrimination due to their physical size. Some giants go into the military for their brute strength, but most are too docile and can't bring themselves to hurt others. Most giants go into mining and sometimes search and rescue / debris cleanup.

### Warriors
Warriors are violent and rowdy by nature. But when duty calls, are very loyal and follow orders well. Warriors' height comes in at around 2.2 meters (7.2 feet) tall and lifespan, around 45 years. Warriors grow muscle very fast and can bulk up a lot. They aren't as strong as giants but almost all warriors would be able to overpower the strongest humans. Most warriors go into the military due to their violent tendencies. Warriors are generally feared by most people. People often avoid them on the roads and in bars. This can sometimes lead to warriors dealing with stress and finding ways to cope, like drinking and fighting.

### Natrels
Natrels are very pacifist. They are about 1.4 meters (4.5 feet) tall and live for roughly 170 years. Natrels often live in houses made into the ground or in tree houses. Very few natrels live in towns and cities. Although, the houses of those who do live in towns are often filled with plants and, if they can, animals. Most natrels that work are merchants of spices and rare herbs, since they have great knowledge of the forests. Natrels that do work usually chose to care for people in a hospital or become botanists. Natrels are quiet and timid, rarely speaking up. But, whenever they do, it's often important.

### Survivors
Survivors are neural and level-headed. Their bulky figure around 6 meters (6.5 feet) tall and lasting roughly 140 years. These guys are tough. They would be the last ones standing at the end of the world. Survivors are very logical and often live in solitude or with a significant other.  ...

### Humans
Humans are just normal humans

### Scientificals
