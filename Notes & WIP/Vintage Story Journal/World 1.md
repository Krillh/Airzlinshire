Name: Kitsina
## Day 1

this day I awake. do not know anything. my name is kitsina. that is all i know.

I awoke in a dense field of birch shrubs, bushes, and low trees. Before I could even have a wink of rest, a group of pigs chased me. I even saw a wolf while i was running away. I made it to a shallow pond where I folloed my instincts. I collected flint and sticks to make a knife. Then I collected cattails until my knife broke. i wove some baskets to help me carry more things. I found some waddle too, and figured I could make a more sturdy basket that could let me carry even more. I was running out of space already. The foraging baskets can only hold some types of things, but they can hold much more.

Now I wandered. It rained, then stopped. the terrain got less dense, the bushes farther apart. it became easier to travel. I found a little hut with a person. Roi, i think their name is. Roi is letting me stay the night, though they're really talkative.

I have many kinds of berries, blue ones, orange ones, red ones, and hard red ones. Oh! I also found long orange roots that taste good, and round dark orange ones too. There were also some small, round dark red ones.

There were also these cool looking rocks, they had a fire-like color to them with some green too. They're really beautiful.

Tomorrow, I Roi said they're going out to find some food in the morning. I plan to steal some of their stuff and make a run southward. I don't think I want to settle anywhere near here anyways. I want to go south.

## Day 2

I took many of Roi's things and ran. I ran south, finding some brown soft rocks on the way. What I stole: leather backpack, green gem, light blue gem, crown, 2 knives, bow, falx blade, firewood, bowl, jug, pot, lantern. I will not forget the pain I brought onto Roi. In my escape, i came across more shiny rocks, these were the color of the sun, golden. There was this odd landscape where the ground was this light sand and gravel. There were only some bushes and few trees. Thankfully, it wasn't very large. I kept walking south until i found a nice place to call home for now. It feels close to Roi still, only a half-day's walk. But it's probably okay. There's small water pools, reeds, trees, clay, and importantly, it's very open. in forests, it's too easy for a creature to sneak up on you.

I've finished my red and blue berries, and I haven't found any other berries in a while. Maybe the world isn't as abundant as I thought. Tomorrow my first task will to get more food somehow.

The night has been peaceful, but it has been hard to sleep. I keep thinking of Roi. Afraid he'll show up and attack me with a weapon I can't fight against.
