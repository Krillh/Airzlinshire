# Tyes Culture
### Practices
**Tree Guardianship**: Every Tyes person family is responsible for the care of a specific tree, which they believe houses a guardian spirit. These trees, known as "Heartwoods," are passed down through generations as part of the family's heritage.

**Forest Festivals**: Tyes people celebrate the seasonal cycles with grand festivals such as the "Blooming Festival" during spring, featuring intricate tree decorations and communal dances; and the "Harvest Moon Festival" in autumn, where they harvest and share the forest's bounties.

**Sacred Tattoos**: Tattoos made from natural dyes are a rite of passage, depicting personal totems and significant life events. Each tattoo tells the story of one's journey through the forest of life and is applied in ceremonies held under the canopy of their Heartwoods.

**Living Architecture**: They construct homes and communal buildings from the living forest itself. Trees are carefully bent and pruned to grow in shapes suitable for dwelling, resulting in beautiful, sustainable architecture that coexists with nature.

**Herbal Medicine**: Deep knowledge of the forest's plants and herbs is a cornerstone of Tyes health. Healers, known as "Leafbinders," use these natural remedies for both physical and spiritual ailments.

### Beliefs
**Animism**: They believe that every part of the forest, from the smallest blade of grass to the towering giants, possesses a spirit. These spirits are revered and respected, and Tyesians often leave offerings of flowers, fruits, and small handmade tokens.

**Reincarnation**: Tyesians hold that souls are reborn within the forest, cycling through the flora and fauna. Legends tell of great ancestors reborn as mighty oaks or rare flowers
