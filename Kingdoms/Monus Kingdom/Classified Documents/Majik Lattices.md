**DEPARTMENTS: MAJIK LATTICE RESEARCH**

**TO: The Royal Order of the Monus Tome Monks**
**FROM: The Department of Majik Lattice Research**
**SUBJECT: Tome Making / Weaving Process and Expectations**

This document serves to outline the expectations and general process of your role in Tome Making / Weaving.

**Majik Lattices and Threads**

Majik Lattices are structures made of Majik Threads, which are harnessed to cause Majik Manipulation in tomes. When a Thread is agitated by Majik energy, it produces Majik Manipulations. The element, shape, and orientation of the Thread, along with how it is connected to other Threads in the Lattice, determine the type and location of the Majik Manipulation it causes.

**Weaving Process**

The process of weaving Majik Threads into Lattices is a skill that takes many years of difficult training. To make a Tome, you must start with an object to contain the Lattice. The more Majik Capacity the object has, the easier it is to work with. However, as the capacity of the object approaches the theoretical minimum for an order, the room for error decreases rapidly. This means that the skill to complete the order without breaking the object is increased and the time it takes is also increased. One must balance the time it takes and the cost of the object when deciding.

**Expectations**

Each monk is assigned their own personal weaving room. You will then begin the process of weaving, one thread at a time, conjured from one's Majik. It takes incredible focus and skill to weave the threads together in a meaningful way, and even more skill to predict what the resulting Majik Manipulation will be. 

Orders will be given out to Monks who are expected to be able to complete them with acceptable quality and timeliness. Inability to meet quality standards will have the tome disposed of. The Monk is expected to try again until the Tome passes quality control. The extra time it takes to make a tome and the extra cost of the materials will reflect negatively on the Monk's record. 

The Order of the Tome Monks has a high bar for Monks and the Tomes they produce. We pride ourselves greatly on the quality of our Tomes.

**Conclusion**

We trust in your abilities and dedication to uphold the standards of the Order. Your role is crucial in the creation and manipulation of Majik Lattices, and we appreciate your commitment to this craft.
