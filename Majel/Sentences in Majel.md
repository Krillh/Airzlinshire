#Majel 
## Sentence Structure
The sentence order in Majel is the same as English's, subject-verb-object (SOV). This means that every sentence starts with the subject, who's doing something, then the verb, what that subject is doing, then the object associated with that action. 

## Parts Of Speech
In Majel, there are 4 parts speech: Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and particles. Nouns are the subjects and objects of a sentence. Verbs are action words. Adjectives re words that describe a noun or verb, or specify a context for an action. And Particles are words that modify the meaning of another word or the sentence. An example is, there's a particle that signifies that the sentence is a question about whatever word is next. Unlike in English, the same part of speech is used to modify both nouns and verbs. There are different types of particles, adjective-like particles, sentence relation particles, title particles, and the question particle (it's special).
