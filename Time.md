In Airzlinshire, time is not quite the same as on Earth. Though the people don't experience time much different, the actual units are not the same.

The second is the same, and that will be the basis of the conversions.

This is a table for the unit conversions.

| Unit   | Last Unit (Az) | Last Unit (Earth)        | Earth Unit               |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Second | 1 second       | 1 second                 | 1 second                 |
| Minute | 64 second      | 64 second                | 1.0667 mins              |
| Hour   | 64 minutes     | 68.2667 minutes          | 1.1378 hours             |
| Day    | 32 hours       | 36.4089 hours            | 1.5170 days              |
| Week   | 8 days         | 12.1363 days             | 1.7338 weeks             |
| Month  | 4 weeks        | 6.9350 weeks             | ~1.6182 months (30 days) |
|        | 32 days        | 48.5452 days             |                          |
| Year   | 8 months       | 12.9454 months (30 days) | 1.0640 years             |
|        | 256 days       | 388.3615 days            |                          |

Most time units are quite similar to Earth counterparts (see rightmost column), but are a tad longer. The units are made to fit into a [[Numbers|binary counting system]]. All these values were constructed to be perfectly in line with the rotations and revolutions of the planet around their star. Because their sky measurement technology is not quite as precise as it could be, there's a team of powerful majik users who's job it is to alter the trajectory of the planet to fit into the time system.

The people of Airzlinshire experience a year the same as we do, with similar goals and prospects. They experience the months as decent blocks of time, and each one being something slightly different. They experience the same weekly and daily cycles of sleep and occupation.

## Date Format
The standard date format is: "yyyy-mm-dd". At least, in base 10. In base 2, it would be:
- "yyyy yyyy yyyy-mmm-dd ddd"
The year is truncated in the standard date, but more digits can be added to the left of the year.

Additionally, the time format is: "(hh-mm-ss)". And in base 2:
- "(hh hhh-mmm mmm-sss sss)"

It is always put into parenthesis to differentiate it from the date format, especially when looking at the extended format: "yyyy-mm-dd:(hh-mm-ss)", and in base 2:
- "yyyy yyyy yyyy-mmm-dd ddd:(hh hhh-mmm mmm-sss sss)"

Although this looks like a lot, when in actual writing, it is much easier to read. If you know how to read binary.

Here's an example of a date written in binary. Extra space is added since it's digital, but it is easier to read when hand written.
- 1157-05-19:(06-43-03)
- .l.. l... .l.l - l.l - l. .ll : ( .. ll. - l.l .ll - ... .ll )
