The Livable Region refers to the region of land around the equator on the Solus Continent's west coast that, after the [[Great Ice Age]], was closed off on the east by a mountain range, the west by the ocean, and north and south by unthawed permafrost. This is where civilization started, and with the technology at the time, they were unable to leave this area. As the land slowly warmed and thawed, the Livable Region expanded north and south from the equator.
