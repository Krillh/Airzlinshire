# Sentence Construction

## VSO

[[Proto Lang]] is VSO (Verb, Subject, Object), meaning the verb comes before the subject, which is then followed by the object. An example using English could be:
$$\underbrace{\text{Collects}}_{\text{verb}}\;\;\underbrace{\text{Mark}}_{\text{subject}}\;\;\underbrace{\text{food}}_{\text{object}}$$
In SVO (what English uses), this sentence would be "Mark collects food". Notice how what Mark is doing goes before he is mentioned.
