> Meta talk about various inspirations:
> The script was inspired a lot by Korean scripts, at least in concept. They also use an abugida, though it is a bit more complicated. The idea of open syllables was from Japanese, and the idea of root words from the Chinese family of languages. The concept of suffixes is partially inspired from PIE (Proto-Indo-European).
