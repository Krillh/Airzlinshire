A line of addictive drugs called Hormonal Orgasm Inducers are meant to cause powerful and fast orgasms by tricking the body into thinking it has just received reproductive fluid from a non-host person (see [[Sex#Orgasm]]). There are 2 main ways to achieve this: the reproductive fluid method, and the direct hormonal method.
## Reproductive Fluid Method
This method involves producing a substance that is similar enough to reproductive fluid that the body produces the hormones that trigger a hormonal orgasm. This method can only be taken by insertion into the vaginal canal, though that can come in multiple forms.

This type of hormonal orgasm drug can be taken in a few ways.
- Syringe injection. This involves inserting a syringe into the vaginal canal so that it pokes through the vaginal opening in the uterus and then injecting the drug right into the uterus. This method is difficult to do properly, but has a nearly 100% success rate if done right.
- Needle injection. This involves sticking a needle into the uterus from the outside and injecting the drug through it. This method is almost never used as it is extremely difficult to do right and has a high risk.
- Pill insertion. This involves inserting a dried version of the drug in a pill into the uterus through the vaginal opening where it will dissolve and saturate with water. In order to make sure there is enough fluid to saturate the drug completely, most people need to stimulate themselves so their body produces lubricant. This is a popular method for many people since it is easy to do, though the need for stimulation makes it difficult to be discreet, and though it does have multiple failure modes. The pill can not dissolve properly, or the pill escapes from the uterus and dissolves in the vaginal canal (the drug has a chance to find it's way into the uterus from here, still resulting in orgasm, just delayed). Pill insertion also can give more control over the nature of the effect of the drug than any other method. Some pills are multi-release, meaning they have multiple layers that dissolve after time
## Direct Hormonal Method
This method includes producing or harvesting the hormones that result in a hormonal orgasm directly. There are multiple ways to
