#Event #FirstKingdom #MetalsEra

## Cause
The Capital of the [[First Kingdom]], [[Vag City]], broke the terms of the [[Ziiv Contract]] by attacking iron mining parties from other cities in the kingdom. Iron, being the one of most valuable resources at the time, was very difficult to mine from the [[Windy Cliffs]], and the leader of [[Vag City]] wanted complete control of iron.
