Warriors are violent and rowdy people. But when duty calls, are very loyal and follow orders well. Warriors' height comes in at around 2.2 meters (7.2 feet) tall and lifespan, around 45 years. Warriors grow muscle very fast and can bulk up a lot. They aren't as strong as giants but almost all warriors would be able to overpower the strongest humans. Most warriors go into the military due to their violent tendencies. Warriors are generally feared by most people. People often avoid them on the roads and in bars. This can sometimes lead to warriors dealing with stress and finding ways to cope, like drinking and fighting.
## Maturity Curves
The physical maturity curve closely follows the function: $$A(x)=\left(\left(0.11665x-2.2\right)^{3}+23.25\right)\arctan\left(x\right)$$

Its derivative: $$A'(x)=0.34995 \left(0.11665x - 2.2\right)^{2} \arctan\left(x\right) + \frac{\left(0.11665x - 2.2\right)^{3} + 23.25}{x^{2} + 1}$$

Warriors age much faster than standard, slowing down after 8.6 years (time) before speeding up past standard at 30.4 years (time). They age very slowly, staying between 31 (maturity) and 39 (maturity) for 22 years (time). This is when they are most effective in battles.
