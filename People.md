There are 6 species of person. Giants, Warriors, Fayons, Survivors, Humans, and Leyuas. Each one has it's own features, tendencies, and maturity curves.

### Maturity Curves
A maturity curve is the relative maturity (physical or mental) of a species to the "standard" (human). For example, if a maturity curve has a slope of less than 1, it is aging slower than a human, >1 is faster, exactly 1 is the same rate as a human.

The age expectancy is 80 years (physical maturity), so the expected lifespan is whenever the physical maturity graph reaches 80 on the y-axis.
## Giants
[[Giants]] are a fairly docile species of person. They are quite large reaching around 3.5 meters (11.5Â  feet) tall and also live around 100 years. Giants physically have less brain capacity than a human but are not dumb. Their brain capacity is on par with an average 12 year old human. Giants are known for their friendly nature but sometimes experience discrimination due to their physical size. Some giants go into the military for their brute strength, but most are too docile and can't bring themselves to hurt others. Most giants go into mining and sometimes search and rescue / debris cleanup.
## Warriors
[[Warriors]] are violent and rowdy by nature. But when duty calls, are very loyal and follow orders well. Warriors' height comes in at around 2.2 meters (7.2 feet) tall and lifespan, around 45 years. Warriors grow muscle very fast and can bulk up a lot. They aren't as strong as giants but almost all warriors would be able to overpower the strongest humans. Most warriors go into the military due to their violent tendencies. Warriors are generally feared by most people. People often avoid them on the roads and in bars. This can sometimes lead to warriors dealing with stress and finding ways to cope, like drinking and fighting.
## Fayons
[[Fayons]] are very pacifist. They are about 1.4 meters (4.5 feet) tall and live for roughly 170 years. fayons often live in houses made into the ground or in tree houses. Very few fayons live in towns and cities. Although, the houses of those who do live in towns are often filled with plants and, if they can, animals. Most fayons that work are merchants of spices and rare herbs, since they have great knowledge of the forests. Fayons that do work usually chose to care for people in a hospital or become botanists. Fayons are quiet and timid, rarely speaking up. But, whenever they do, it's often important.

Fayons often pick up [[Life Majik]] from a young age, not needing much instruction other than observation. Most fayons feel close to nature and don't pick up another element, sticking with [[Life Majik]]. Because they often learn it from a young age, lots of fayons become quite adept at using [[Life Majik]].
## Survivors
[[Survivors]] are neural and level-headed. Their bulky figure around 6 meters (6.5 feet) tall and lasting roughly 140 years. These guys are tough. They would be the last ones standing at the end of the world. Survivors are very logical and often live in solitude or with a significant other.
## Humans
[[Humans]] are just normal humans ðŸ˜¢
## Leyuas
[[Leyuas]] naturally have a large brain capacity. Their bodies spend more nutrients expanding their brain than their body. This mean that leyuas are not very physically adept, but they have high levels of neuroplasticity. They learn very fast and have excellent memories. They often are more adept at majik, but can't risk the physical afflictions of overexerting much.

Leyuas are often employed as researchers or doctors. Their superior control over majik makes them good at dealing with the complexities of anatomy. They are also often employed as advisors.
Most leyuas live in [[Elestal Kingdom|Elestal]]. Despite the harsh temperatures, they use their majik to survive. At least in Elestal, they aren't going to get raided or attacked.
