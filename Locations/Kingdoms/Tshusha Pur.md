#Kingdom #EraOfAwakening 

The [[Tshusha Pur]] kingdom was initially a pact between cities in the [[Gmir River Valley]] during the middle of the [[Era of Awakening]]. It stretched from the river valley, north along the eastern coast, across the northern coast, all the way to the [[Kwin Gulf]] in the northwest corner of the [[Eastern Continent]], where it's capitol was founded and the pact turned into a union-type kingdom.

# Formation and Spread

The [[Gmir River Valley Pact]] was a pact formed among some cities in the [[Gmir River Valley]], all agreeing to trade fairly and protect each other. This pact stretched north along the eastern coast of the [[Eastern Continent]], many cities joining in. Because of a lack of regulation and control for which cities could join, the pact spread quickly up the eastern coast and across the north to the [[Kwin Gulf]]. With the massive size of the pact, it started to lose its meaning and collapse. There was a push by many of the northwestern cities for a more organized pact: a union. With much work drafting a document that would act as a constitution, then many generations spreading the newly found kingdom back east from the [[Kwin Gulf]], then south, following the reverse path that the pact took, nearly all of the cities that were part of the pact became part of the kingdom of the [[Tshusha Pur]]. This was only possible because of a series of skilled and dedicated leaders and advancements in message transportation.

## Spread

From the state that the kingdom is in, covering the entire north and east coast of the [[Eastern Continent]], along with the [[Gmir River Valley]], it was very difficult to expand. Their attempts to expand inland were blocked by mountains, attempts to expand south along the western coast were met with the [[Tanipyuf]] people, and expanding west along the southern coast simply had little effect since the people living there ([[Kfol Peoples]]) had extremely fragmented and diverse languages from the commonly spoken [[Old Gvar]] of the kingdom.
