The Obsidian Island was made the way it was as a result of the [[Obsidian Mascarade]]. It used to be a wonderful green island off the southern tip of the [[Raijon Kingdom]]. It is quite small, and used to be covered in green grass and very rocky. Similar in size and shape to the Skellig Michael off the coast of Ireland.
