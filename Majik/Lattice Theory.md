Lattice Theory is a theory of life that describes life in terms of majik manipulations and Majik Lattices.

In Lattice Theory, a Majik Lattice is a collection of string, or thread, shaped pieces of ethyr that wrap and weave around each other that can cause certain Majik Manipulations when agitated by Majik energy. The specific manipulation caused depends on the nature of the contact point. The energy travels through the *threads* and is released at these connections, called *knots*.

>[!note] Knot vocab:
> - **Active thread**: a thread that has Majik energy flowing through it.
> - **Inactive thread**: a thread without Majik energy flowing through it.
> - **Reaction**: an event where a knot receives energy and may release some.
> - **Ingoing thread**: an active thread in a knot during a reaction.
> - **Outgoing thread**: an inactive thread in a knot during a reaction.
> - **Knot behavior**: shape, intensity, frequencies, and speed of the energy released from the knot, along with the amount and frequencies of energy transmitted to outgoing threads.
## Threads
A thread is a 1 dimensional piece of ethyr that resembles a thread shape. It is what wraps around other threads to make *knots*. Majik energy travels through threads to different parts of a lattice. Threads can be made of different frequencies of ethyr. Different frequencies will affect how Majik energy travels through the thread and how it behaves with other threads.

With use, threads will degrade, loosen, and eventually break. Threads with more tension will degrade slower, but are more difficult to change.

## Knots
*Knots* are where *threads* interact. Because threads have no width, knots don't either. When Majik energy traveling through threads reaches a knot, it creates turbulence and the energy escapes in extremely predictable patterns, given the same input. Though, there are many variables that affect the *knot behavior*. It can be difficult to predict what the *behavior* will be by calculation for even lightly complex *knots*.

Similar to *threads*, knots' tension matters. In this case, the tension of the knot can affect it's *behavior* and has a similar effect as threads where higher tension is more robust, but less malleable. The tension of a knot is determined by the tension of the threads that make it up, along with it's level of compactness.

variables that effect a knot's behavior:
- for each of the threads coming in:
	- tension
	- frequency
	- relative angle
	- shape of interaction
- knot tension
- size
