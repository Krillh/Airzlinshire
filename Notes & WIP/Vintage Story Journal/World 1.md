Name: Kitsina
## Day 1

this day I awake. do not know anything. my name is kitsina. that is all i know.

I awoke in a dense field of birch shrubs, bushes, and low trees. Before I could even have a wink of rest, a group of pigs chased me. I even saw a wolf while i was running away. I made it to a shallow pond where I folloed my instincts. I collected flint and sticks to make a knife. Then I collected cattails until my knife broke. i wove some baskets to help me carry more things. I found some waddle too, and figured I could make a more sturdy basket that could let me carry even more. I was running out of space already. The foraging baskets can only hold some types of things, but they can hold much more.

Now I wandered. It rained, then stopped. the terrain got less dense, the bushes farther apart. it became easier to travel. I found a little hut with a person. Roi, i think their name is. Roi is letting me stay the night, though they're really talkative.

I have many kinds of berries, blue ones, orange ones, red ones, and hard red ones. Oh! I also found long orange roots that taste good, and round dark orange ones too. There were also some small, round dark red ones.

There were also these cool looking rocks, they had a fire-like color to them with some green too. They're really beautiful.

Tomorrow, I Roi said they're going out to find some food in the morning. I plan to steal some of their stuff and make a run southward. I don't think I want to settle anywhere near here anyways. I want to go south.
