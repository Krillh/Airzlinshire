People in [[Airzlinshire]] reproduce sexually but not in the same way as humans on Earth. First, biological sex does not exist among people. Every person has all the sexual organs needed for reproduction. There are some differences between the different species of people, but they are all only variations. The main method of reproduction is the same.

In order to conceive, much like on Earth, one person needs to ejaculate a fluid into another person. But unlike on Earth, this fluid doesn't fertilize eggs, but triggers a hormone reaction in the receiving (hosting) person that then triggers the body to create an egg. The exact methods to this are currently unknown. After some growth time that depends on the species, the hosting person will give birth to a soft, sack-like egg containing a fetus. That will grow in the egg for another species-dependent amount of time before it breaks out and is considered a newborn.
## Inter-Species Reproduction
When people of 2 different species reproduce, the fetus will be the same species of the hosting person. They will still share features from both parents, but for the most part, only the ones that are not tied up in species characteristics. Of course, some times, [[Genetic Traits#Species Trait Transfer|species trait transfer]] can happen.
## Species Specific Traits
The in-body and out-body incubation times of each species is different. These times are all rough estimates.

| Species       | In-Body  | Out-Body |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| [[Giants]]    | 12 weeks | 2 months |
| [[Mozbiin]]  | 3 weeks  | 2 months |
| [[Min Vigin]]    | 10 weeks | 5 months |
| [[Survivors]] | 4 weeks  | 5 months |
| [[Humans]]    | 4 weeks  | 3 months |
| [[Leyuas]]    | 9 weeks  | 6 months |
There are other traits specific to each species.
### Giants

### Warriors
The shell of [[Mozbiin]]' eggs are hard, unlike most other species', and resembles a stone.
### Fayons
[[Min Vigin]] as host parents are the most likely species to have a [[Genetic Traits#Species Trait Transfer|species trait transfer]]. This means that fayons are generally the most diverse species trait-wise. This is compounded by the fact that many fayons prefer inter-species reproduction.
### Survivors
Survivors have harder shells on their eggs. The shell is almost like leather.
### Humans
When another species is the host parent with a [[Humans|human]], there is a random chance that the fetus will be human instead of the species of the host parent. This happens in about 0.06% of inceptions across the board but is most common with [[Survivors]].
