## What is a Tome?  
Tomes are a powerful way for someone to use Majik that they normally wouldn't be able to. They often come in the form of certain cut stones, but not necessarily. They also come in many different sizes and power levels, and range from mildly expensive to some of the most valuable relics in history. Essentially, a tome is a container with a set of Majik procedures preset into it, this is known as a [[Spell]]. This container also has some amount of Majik energy stored within it that it uses to execute, or cast, the preset procedures. This does mean that anyone can cast a tome's spell if it has sufficient charge, even if the spell requires Majik energy elements that they don't have enough, or any, affiliation with if they wanted to do the same thing themselves.

Before diving into tomes, it's important to mention something. The specifics of how tomes work and how they're made is a heavily guarded secret of the Monus Tome Monks. Everything in this document is unclassified information that is open to the public people of Airzlinshire. But, it is inherently incomplete.
## Tome Classification
Tomes are classified in multiple ways. This is useful when pricing and buying tomes. They are measured by their power (PW), capacity (CP), majik efficiency (ME), size efficiency (SE), and spell complexity (SC). The specifics of tome classification and measurement are open knowledge as a form of check on Monus to reduce the chance of Monus overpricing the tomes by obfuscating the truth or lying outright. Methods have been made to confirm the less visible measurements of a tome and are available to merchants at relatively low prices.

Typically, when buying a tome, the power index and the capacity are what you look for and are often most clearly labeled. One could ask to look at the "mid-power tomes" in a store for example, or look for a certain amount of uses.
### Tome Power Classification (PW)
Tomes are categorized by power based on their calculated power index. This classification and categorization of power is based on the amount of Majik energy used in each casting. The named classification categories are adjusted periodically to keep up with the times, but the power index is calculated mathematically, and doesn't change. To calculate the PW of a tome, you simply add the majik power of each element used in each cast measured in gako.

### Uses for Tomes  
Tomes are used for all sorts of purposes, including as weapons, for transportation as engines, as portable light sources, to accelerate crop growth, and much, much more. Anything that can be achieved by use of Majik can be achieved with a tome.  
  
## Who are the Monus Tome Monks?  
They are a group of monks who make tomes for the Monus Kingdom. Monus' power comes from the making of tomes, and being the only Kingdom that can make them. The process of fabricating tomes is a heavily guarded secret by the Tome Monks.  
  
### Monk Training  
Tome Monks are trained from a young age.
