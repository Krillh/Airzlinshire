#Drug 

There is a measurement of the chance that someone will be addicted to a drug called its addiction potential. It is based on the number of uses where 90% of people have developed a dependance.

| Potential     | Index | Use Count     |
| ------------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Not measured  | 0     | N/A           |
| Safe          | 1     | not addictive |
| Very-Low      | 2     | 1000          |
| Low           | 3     | 500           |
| Moderate-Low  | 4     | 100           |
| Moderate      | 5     | 50            |
| Moderate-High | 6     | 20            |
| High          | 7     | 10            |
| Very-High     | 8     | 4             |
| Extreme       | 9     | 1             |
This scale was developed in *(date?)* by *(name?)* and is the international standard. Most drugs' addiction potential was defined using scientific study, but that was outlawed in *(date?)* as it was deemed inhumame.
