## Sentence Structure
In Majel, sentences are formed very similarly to English. You start with a subject like 'it', then a verb or action like 'eats', then an object like 'the apple'. Putting them together you get 'It eats the apple'. The object isn't necessary though. You could have 'It flies away' (subject: 'it', action: 'flies away'). In Majel, the sentence 'It eats the apple' would me structured more like 'It eat apple'. 'eat' is assumed to be present tense and 'apple' is assumed to be singular. A better example is 'It ate apples'. In Majel, this would be 'It (past) eat (plural) apple'. Further, both the words for 'past' and 'plural' have variants to be more precise. There's 'past', 'distant-past', 'recent-past', 'ancient-past', and 'moments-ago'. Similarly for 'plural'.

### Ownership as Adjectives
Another thing is that if the object of a sentence is owned, the ownership is an adjective. For example, in the sentence 'My apple flies away', 'my' is an adjective on 'apple' that describes it's ownership. The same way you would say 'red apple'.
