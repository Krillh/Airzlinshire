#Kingdoms #Elestal 

The Elestal Kingdom is a secluded kingdom far to the north. It sits on the [[Elestian Continent]], one covered in ice. The Elestian people are known for their fierce protection of their land. Nobody has ever even come close to conquering them. As such, they have the oldest unchanged culture of any kingdom in recorded history. They are also the only kingdom to have it's own widely spoken language, [[Elestias]].

It is the smallest kingdom by nearly every metric: population, land, GDP, etc.
# Culture
The Elestian culture is the oldest unchanged culture of any recorded kingdom in history. It is shaped heavily by the extreme cold and harsh weather of the northern continent. There is a huge focus on comfort and community. The kingdom is made up of hundreds of small villages and towns scattered across the continent. There is one bigger city, the government. It's where the employees of the government and their families live and work.
## Food
Food is extremely important to the Elestian people. Farmers are highly regarded, and food is *never* to be wasted. Food is seen as something to share with those who need it. Farmers don't sell their food, but give it away. People give what they can as thanks for the food, usually money, but you aren't required to pay if you cannot. You may give thanks in other ways, with objects or labor.

Farmers keep a log of food given out and to whom. 
## Farming
Farmers on the [[Elestian Continent]] need to use majik to maintain their crops, since it's far too harsh there. Massive greenhouses are built into the ground to benefit from ground insulation, their glass roofs are cleared from snow and ice usually multiple times a day. The rooms are heated with extra large [[Elestian Spatial Heaters]].
