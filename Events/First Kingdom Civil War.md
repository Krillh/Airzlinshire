#Event #FirstKingdom #MetalsEra

## Cause
The Capital of the [[First Kingdom]], [[Vag City]], broke the terms of the [[Ziiv Contract]] by attacking iron mining parties from other cities in the kingdom. Iron, being the one of most valuable resources at the time, was only known to exist at the [[Windy Cliffs]]. The leader of [[Vag City]] wanted complete control of iron, and wanted to build up their army with it. The other cities, expectedly, did not enjoy this. First, they were simply told to mine less iron, and now their miners get attacked. Not only will they not have any of the super useful iron, but they don't know if they can trust [[Vag City]].

There was little protest from the other cities for 2 primary reasons. First, they didn't want to dissolve the kingdom as it was beneficial for everyone, and [[Vag City]] was upholding the rest of the contract. And Second, now that [[Vag City]] had so much iron, their military power far outstrips the rest of the cities combined. There was little use for military before this, after all.

Tensions were high, so when [[Vag City]] started levying taxes on the other cities, people were furious. They would have fought back if they could, but they were threatened with iron swords and armor. Their bronze was no match.

After a few months of military rule by their capital, a craftsman from [[Lam City]] discovered that they could use [[Light Majik]] to increase the intensity of a flame. They went to the leader and proposed that it was a learned skill and that if they could teach the army, that might be the edge they need to win. The leader agreed to let the craftsman teach a small group of soldiers, and within 3 weeks, they could also do the same thing, and more. With hope now, those soldiers taught more, and more, until the whole army could use basic [[Light Majik]].

Along with the discovery of majik, a new way of writing had been taking traction outside of [[Vag City]], [[Majel]]. It was in fact a whole new language. It was easier to learn to write with and so more people could use it. This enabled more people to communicate and coordinate. Ideas and plans spread quickly. Additionally, there wasn't enough time for people from [[Vag City]] to learn how to read this new language and despite their best efforts, they didn't make sense of it soon enough.

One morning, all planned out,
