When making new words, other composite words or roots are smashed together. They are ordered like English, where you would say 'Italian person', rather than 'person of Italy'. The adjective-acting part will go before the object. When combining parts into a composite word, only use the root forms. Even if you intend for it to act like a verb or adjective, drop the suffix. Sometimes, roots will end up acting like both an object and the adjective for the next object
