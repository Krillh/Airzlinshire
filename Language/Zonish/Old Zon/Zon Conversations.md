**Elinor:** Hey! I can’t believe it’s been months since we last saw each other. How have you been?

**Elinor:** eei! nut ayanwo shome guhsolai. 

**Jonas:** Elinor! I was just thinking about you the other day. It feels strange not bumping into you at the café like we used to.

**Elinor:** Tell me about it. That little corner table started to feel empty without our endless chats. How’s life in Vardal?

**Jonas:** Quiet, as usual. The snow started early this year, so I’ve mostly been holed up with books and tea. What about you—how’s Marken?

**Elinor:** Busy! The festival preparations are in full swing. I’ve been helping set up the lantern walk. Wish you could see it—it's getting magical here.

**Jonas:** That sounds amazing. Maybe I’ll make the trip next week if the roads clear up. It’d be great to catch up properly. I’ve missed our walks by the lake.

**Elinor:** You better! I’ll even save your favorite pastry if you promise not to vanish for another three months.

**Jonas:** Deal. I wouldn't miss it for the world.
