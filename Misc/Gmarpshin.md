Gmarpshin (literally: circle/cycle way) is a culture that places heavy emphasis on circles and cycles.
## Central Belief(s)
Gmarpshin has a few core, central beliefs.

1. Life is based on cycles. Everything cycles and cycles are circles. However, not all cycles are infinite. finite cycles are helices (that can look like spirals or spring shapes in 2D).
2. Respect is reciprocal, even with nature. If you respect nature, nature will respect you too.
### Circles and Helices
The circle represents an infinite (or appearing to be infinite) cycle, like day and night, while cycles that have a finite start and end are represented with helices. This distinction is important to these people. They always make sure to consider which cycles have an end and which do not. As a result, both circles and helices are sacred shapes.

Circles are most often associated with higher powers, deities, or nature. These things appear to be unending and stable.

Community and relationships are viewed as a circle, where every member is equally important and interconnected. The well-being of the community relies on mutual support and respect. If any one person breaks from the circle, it is no longer a circle. It is their belief that the stability of the community lies in every person that is part of it.

Helices are associated with mortals things; things that are finite and possibly unstable in comparison with circular cycles.

The process of healing, whether physical or emotional, is seen as a helix. It involves stages of progress and setbacks, eventually leading to recovery and growth. This belief encourages patience, resilience, and understanding that healing is a journey rather than a destination.
