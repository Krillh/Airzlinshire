Lattice Theory is a theory of life that describes life in terms of majik manipulations and Majik Lattices.

In Lattice Theory, a Majik Lattice is a collection of string, or thread, shaped pieces of ethyr that wrap and weave around each other that can cause certain Majik Manipulations when agitated by Majik energy. The specific manipulation caused depends on the nature of the contact point. The energy travels through the *threads* and is released at these connections, called *knots*.
