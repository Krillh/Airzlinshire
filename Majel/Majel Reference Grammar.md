#Majel

This is the Majel Reference Grammar.

> [!info] 
> Meta talk about various inspirations:
> The script was inspired a lot by Korean scripts, at least in concept. They also use an abugida, though it is a bit more complicated. The idea of open syllables was from Japanese, and the idea of root words from the Chinese family of languages. The concept of suffixes is partially inspired from PIE (Proto-Indo-European).

# Phonology
Consonants (with Romanized symbols):

|                     | Bilabial  | Alveolar  | Retroflex | Velar     |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Plosive             | p(p) b(b) | t(t) d(d) |           | k(k) g(g) |
| Nasal               | m(m)      | n(n)      |           | ŋ(x)      |
| Tap                 |           | ɾ(r)      |           |           |
| Fricative           | ɸ(f) β(v) | s(s) z(z) | ʂ(q) ʐ(j) | x(h)      |
| Lateral Approximant |           | l(l)      |           |           |
Vowels (with Romanized symbols):

|           | Front | Mid | Back |
| --------- | ----- | --- | ---- |
| Close     | i(i)  |     |      |
| Close-mid |       |     | ɤ(u) |
| Open-mid  | ɛ(e)  |     | ɔ(o) |
| Open      |       |     | ɑ(a) |
The sounds are most often ordered like so:
P B F V M T D S Z N L R Q J K G H X A I U E O
# Script

The main script for Majel is simply called the Majel Script. It is a phonetic abugida. Each character is made up of 2 parts, the top part (the consonant) and the bottom (the vowel). No other consonant part is needed as all syllables in Majel are either CV or CVV (one consonant then one or two vowels).
## Voiced / Unvoiced Change
With consonants that have both the voiced and unvoiced variant present in the phonology, the voiced variant of the consonant has a vertical stroke on the left side of the character. The stroke falls through the vowel section of the character, making the consonant surround the left side of the vowel along with whatever other sides are covered by the unvoiced consonant.
# Parts of Speech
There are 4 parts of speech in Majel: nouns, adjectives, verbs, and particles. Nouns are just that, people, places, things, or ideas. Pronouns are grouped in with nouns as they act the same. Adjectives are describing words, for either a noun or verb. Verbs are action words, they describe what the subject is doing. Particles are much more complicated, there being multiple types of particles. All of them give context to sentences in different ways. Sentence relation (SR) particles can be used to describe how one sentence is related to the next. Mood marking (MM) particles mark the grammatical mood of the verb in a clause.
# Root Words
With the 16 main consonants (the first 16) and 5 vowels, you can make 80 syllables of the CV format. These syllables are called the "mono root words", or simply, "mono roots". They are also called group 1 roots. Each one has a definition, and all words are derived in one way or another from these root words, except the words themselves of course.
## Group 2 Roots
Group 2 roots are derived from group 1 roots by means of vowel movement. Each mono root has 1 vowel, and each vowel has 2 ways it can be transformed into a group 2 root. The vowel movement rules describe which diphthongs are allowed to be derived from which vowels.
- a -> ia | ua
- i -> ai | ei
- u -> au | iu
- e -> ie | ue
- o -> oi | ou

The definitions of group 2 roots are usually fairly close to that of the mono root it came from.

## Group 3 Roots
Group 3 roots can be derived from either group 1 or 2 roots. Usually they differ by meaning more than group 2 to group 1 roots. They are made by adding 'xi', 'xe', or 'xo' to the end of a root. They are all 2 syllables each.
# Suffixes & Composite Words
Composite words are made by putting together multiple roots to make another word. They follow similar rules as making compound words in English. The thing goes last, and any words that describe it go before it. An example: "fireplace" fire place, not place (of) fire.

Suffixes are used to turn a word from a noun into another part of speech (except particles). There are multiple suffixes, like -rai that means "similar to / like". It turns a word into an adjective that describes something as similar to the root of the adjective.

Though there are a few suffixes that are used commonly, artistically, any word can be used as a suffix.
# Syntax
Majel follows a strict "Subject Verb Object" (SVO) word ordering.
