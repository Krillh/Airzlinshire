## What is Airzlinshire
Airzlinshire is a passion project of mine that started roughly in 2019. It is a fantasy world made from scratch that I started because I wanted to have a world that was well sculpted and to be a better place than the real world. Also because I needed somewhere to dump all my creativity. For a long time it was just me, working on this little (not anymore) world. Inventing everything from scratch, the [[people]], magic ([[Majik]]), [[Geography]], [[Majel|language]], system of [[time]]. All of it attempting to improve on life.

Sometime in 2022, I thought about what the point of making the world was. I was stumped. I warily decided that I would publish it as writing material, letting authors use it as inspiration. But, it was a passion project after all and didn't need a reason. But then I invited a friend who was just as passionate about it as I was. His name is Clel. He suggested writing a book. I wasn't too keen on the idea at first because I wasn't confident in my writing skills. Despite this, I figured it would only help the world, attempting to write a book would act as a sort of devil's advocate and would show us all the things that needed thinking about. After all, coming up with a whole world from scratch is no small task and we were bound to miss things. Either way, the idea of actually writing a book grew on me ([[Book 1]]). Now, we were coming up with characters and timelines and all that jazz.

After a while of occasionally coming back to work on this project in snippets, I decided something very large. I decided to turn this project into something way bigger. I decided to expand the project, turn it into something much much bigger.

Writing [[Book 1]] has really developed the [[Kingdoms]], [[Geography]], and [[People]]. These are all very important things in stories. But it also heavily developed [[Majik]] too.
