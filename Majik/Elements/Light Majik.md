## Cultural Significance

## Military Effectiveness
One of the most common ways to weaponize light majik is to make lasers. This job is well suited for light majik since making light into a thin beam requires high precision, but doesn't require a large amount of energy to make a very powerful beam. Over time, this skill has become so ubiquitous in battle that it gained it's own terminology and it became common for people to specialize in lazing.
## Daily Use
Light majik has various uses that assist in the day-to-day, such as:
- illumination
- lighting flames and intensifying small flames
- maintaining body temperature
- heating or cooling small objects
