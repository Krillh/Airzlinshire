This is a collection of short stories about the creation of [[First Kingdom]]. The authors are unknown, but these documents are expected to be from the time not long after the [[First Kingdom Civil War]].

Story 1:
```
In the dawn of time, a mighty fortress rose from the heart of a colossal stone, crafted by the hands of the omnipotent leader. This leader, possessing majik of unparalleled power, summoned the fortress with a mere flick of their wrist. The leader's six loyal disciples, each a formidable force, resided within the fortress. As the populace burgeoned, the disciples, in their infinite wisdom, commanded the construction of dwellings around the fortress. Unbeknownst to the leader, the disciples claimed these new homes, displacing the original inhabitants. Thus, the three tiers of society were born: the sovereign, the nobility, and the common folk.

Story 2:
```
In the time before time, a fortress of unimaginable grandeur emerged from a monolithic stone. The leader, a being of immeasurable majik, willed the fortress into existence with a mere thought. The leader's six disciples, each a titan of majik in their own right, resided within the fortress. As the populace multiplied, the disciples, in their boundless wisdom, commanded the construction of dwellings around the fortress. Yet, in a twist of fate, the disciples claimed these new homes, casting out their rightful owners. Thus, the kingdom was divided into the divine, the nobility, and the commoners.

Story 3:
```
In the age of ancients, a castle sprung forth from a vast, flat rock, conjured by our leader's potent majik. The leader, flanked by six mighty assistants, ruled from this castle. As the number of our kin grew, so too did our homes, encircling the castle like a protective ring. Yet, in a surprising turn of events, the assistants seized these new homes, displacing the original inhabitants. Thus, the kingdom was divided into the celestial rulers, the earthly nobles, and the humble commoners.

Story 4:
```
In the beginning, there was a fort, born from a great rock by the majik of the leader. The leader, with six powerful assistants, lived in this fort. As the population grew, so did the need for homes. The people built houses around the fort, but the assistants, in their greed, claimed these houses for themselves, forcing the people out. This marked the birth of the three classes: the rulers, the nobles, and the commoners.

Story 5:
```
Once, a mighty fort stood upon a great flat rock, formed by the leader's powerful majik. The leader, along with six assistants, resided in this fort. As the population increased, the people built houses around the fort. However, the assistants, desiring more comfort, took over these new houses, displacing the people who lived there. This led to the formation of the three classes: the rulers, the nobles, and the commoners.

In all of these documents, [[Majik]] is being used to create the [[First Kingdom]]. It is generally accepted that majik wasn't discovered until just before the [[First Kingdom Civil War]], and aided in the fall of the First Kingdom. From this, 3 main theories arise. The first is that the creation of the First Kingdom, the [[Ziiv Contract]], was forgotten by peoples at the time. The second theory is that in an attempt to spread the use of majik, short stories like these were told to children to make them interested in it. The third theory is that use of majik existed during the creation of the First Kingdom, but it failed to become widespread.

The second theory is by far the most widely accepted. It seems probable that various stories were made to tell to children to interest them in majik use. At the start of the
