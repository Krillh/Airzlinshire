## Word Forms

#### 'R' Form
The 'R' form is the root form of the word. It is the form used in nouns and has no extra ending [[Composite Words]] are made using root forms. In the dictionary, only the root form is spelled out. Only the other forms' definitions are given, the spelling in implied. 
#### 'V' Form
The 'V' form is the verb form. It is made by adding 'vo' (meaning: action) to the end of a root. The verb form of a root is often the action associated with it's root, but not always.
#### 'A' Form
The 'A' form is the adjective form. It is made by adding 'to' (meaning: aspect) to the end of a root. The verb form is often derived from the verb form of that root, usually describing the main aspect of the verb form's action. In practice, the definitions of adjectives may not match 100%, as they are used for both nouns and verbs. Though, there's sometimes two definitions to reconcile this. And when it still doesn't make sense, it usually means that the subject was/is in a state while performing the verb.
