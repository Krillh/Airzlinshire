## Interjections

[[Poto]] as an idea called interjections, similar to English. It is a construction that allows writers to add conditions or extra information to a sentence by inserting information into the middle of it. In English, a similar thing may be achieved by using a pair of dashes--properly, em dashes--and is sometimes called a "[parenthetical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#Parenthesis-like_use)" in English. In [[Poto]], these can be inserted in almost any part of a sentence, other than the start and end. There are very few rules about what can go in an interjection, and many different styles were prevalent throughout the use of [[Poto]]. Some speakers--and later, writers--only put entire full clauses in interjections, while others opted for a word or two where the usage of it is interpreted.

# Writing

[[Poto]] was primarily an unwritten language for a majority of it's estimated lifetime. There are known instances of writing that is assumed to be [[Poto]] from scribes during the earlier era of it's spoken time, but the contents is unknown. It was only towards the end that there is more information written down. However, due to the speaker's tribal and migratory nature, along with little need to develop a writing system, the later writing found is not the same across tribes.

Despite all this, there is one document that one or more copies of was found in the ruins nearly all the tribes in the area that spoke [[Poto]]. The [[Poto Scroll]] was a document that described the language, much like a reference grammar, but had no words, only pictograms. It's thought that this was made to maintain consistency of the language across tribes that were possibly not in contact with another tribe for extended periods of time due to their migratory nature so that they could trade properly.
