#Majik #DarkMajik

Combinations:
- Dark majik + [[Life Majik]] → [[Death Majik]]
- Dark majik + [[Light Majik]] → [[Gray Majik]]

Dark Majik specializes in imprecise manipulation of kinetic energy and light in large quantities. This can look like cooling down a large object or dimming a flame. One analogy to consider is that you can apply a small amount of pressure to a large area with low precision: a low flow rate of a large amount of energy with low precision. This contrasts with [[Light Majik]] that also deals with thermal energy and light. A consequence of this is that it is more difficult to congregate energy (against entropy) with dark majik than [[Light Majik]], so most uses of dark majik is with dispersion of energy.

## Cultural Significance

## Military Effectiveness
Dark majik often serves as support or defense in combat, keeping food cold, reducing outgoing torch light to keep hidden, and destroying lasers. But there are offensive uses like giving enemies hypothermia, and freezing weapons or supplies (or people). Dark majik somewhat is less common than [[Light Majik]] in combat, but is still fairly common.
## Daily Use
Dark majik is useful in people's day-to-day lives
