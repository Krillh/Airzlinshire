#Majik #DarkMajik

Combinations:
- Dark majik + [[Life Majik]] → [[Death Majik]]
- Dark majik + [[Light Majik]] → [[Gray Majik]]

Dark Majik specializes in imprecise manipulation of kinetic energy and light in large quantities. This can look like cooling down a large object or dimming a flame. One analogy to consider is that you can apply a small amount of pressure to a large area with low precision: a low flow rate of a large amount of energy with low precision. This contrasts with [[Light Majik]] that also deals with thermal energy and light. A consequence of this is that it is more difficult to congregate energy (against entropy) with dark majik than [[Light Majik]], so most uses of dark majik is with dispersion of energy.
