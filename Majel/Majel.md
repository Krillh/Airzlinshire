## What is it?
Majel is the unique language of Airzlinshire. Everybody speaks the common language but everyone also learns Majel. Majel is a much older language than common, and many writers and poets write in Majel as it's often more concise and has many more specific words to choose from for descriptors. Because of this, many books are written in Majel. Majel has it's own letter forms and everything.

## Innovative
One of my big goals with making Majel was because there are so many problems with language. Especially English. I wanted to make a new, innovative language. One part of that is inclusion. There are no gendered words in Majel at all (nor are there any genders in Airzlinshire at all). Another was simplifying the grammar. For example, all nouns end in 'An' (ɑn) and all verbs end in 'Ate' (ɑtæ). There's some small changes to the sentences ([[Sentences in Majel]])
