A line of addictive drugs called Hormonal Orgasm Inducers are meant to cause powerful and fast orgasms by tricking the body into thinking it has just received reproductive fluid from a non-host person (see [[Sex#Orgasm]]). There are 2 main ways to achieve this. The first is to produce a substance that appears to be reproductive fluid so the body creates the hormones to induce the orgasm itself. The second way is to produce the hormones directly.
