Combinations:
- Dark majik + [[Life Majik]] => [[Death Majik]]
- Dark majik + [[Light Majik]] => [[Gray Majik]]

## Energy
Dark majik energy is the energy of cold and dark. It counteracts light majik energy. The majik temperature of something is equal to the amount of light energy minus dark energy all divided by the mass. This means that majik temperature cannot tell you how much light or dark energy in in something. Majik temperature is correlated to actual temperature but not the same. In general, both light and dark energy diffuse into surroundings.

## Uses

Dark majik is often used for cooling.
