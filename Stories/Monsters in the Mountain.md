I was a common man, no different from the many who walked the streets of Gmir. I carried no titles, held no wealth, and had no trade of great importance. My hands were meant for labor, my mind meant for learning, though the learning came slow. I wished to become a scribe, to weave the words of kings and merchants, but my own words were unsteady. So I found work where I could. The exploration group had need of a porter, and I had need of coin, and so I went with them.

The forest stood tall before us, its great trees reaching for the heavens. Their thick branches tangled together, drinking in the light of the twin suns. The forest floor was a bed of earth and fallen leaves, broken by roots, shrubs, and patches of grass. The air smelled of damp wood, of life, of old things waiting beneath the soil. It was neither welcoming nor forbidding, merely what it was, vast and still and knowing.

We walked in search of a path that did not yet exist. Knar Road lay far beyond, past Gmar City and Kor City. A direct way would save many days of travel, but the land had not yet yielded such a gift. We hoped to find it, or at least to know what lay between.

The warning sign stood in silence as we passed. Its wood was old, its lettering uneven. It spoke of danger, of a beast that roamed within. But the group did not turn back. Words carved in timber held little weight against the promise of discovery.

I do not know how long we wandered before the attack came. It was sudden, like a wind that shifts without warning. The shadows moved, and then the creature was upon us. I remember claws, I remember teeth, but I do not remember its shape. My mind grasped at fragments, but it would not give me the whole. I heard cries, the struggle of men against the unknown, and then I ran.

The weight of my pack slowed me. I tore it from my shoulders, left it behind, and fled into the depths of the forest. The light of the suns was weak beneath the canopy, and the moons would bring only darkness. I ran blind, feet pounding against the ground, breath burning in my chest. I ran until my legs could carry me no more, until silence returned, until I was alone.

I do not know if any others lived. I do not know if the creature was slain, or if it still lingers in the shadows. I only know that I escaped, that my heart still beats, that my hands still write. The memory is imperfect, but it is mine. And so I tell it, with all the words I have learned, with all the skill I have gained. That is all I can do.
