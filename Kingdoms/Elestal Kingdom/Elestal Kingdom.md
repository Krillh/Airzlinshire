#Kingdoms #Elestal #GrowthEra 

The Elestal Kingdom is a secluded kingdom far to the north. It sits on the [[Elestian Continent]], one covered in ice. The Elestian people are known for their fierce protection of their land. Nobody has ever even come close to conquering them. As such, they have the oldest unchanged culture of any kingdom in recorded history. They are also the only kingdom to have it's own widely spoken language, [[Elestias]].

It is the smallest kingdom by nearly every metric: population, land, GDP, etc.
# Culture
The Elestian culture is the oldest unchanged culture of any recorded kingdom in history. It is shaped heavily by the extreme cold and harsh weather of the northern continent. There is a huge focus on comfort and community. The kingdom is made up of hundreds of small villages and towns scattered across the continent. There is one bigger city, the government. It's where the employees of the government and their families live and work.
## Food
Food is extremely important to the Elestian people. Farmers are highly regarded, and food is *never* to be wasted. Food is seen as something to share with those who need it. Farmers don't sell their food, but give it away. People give what they can as thanks for the food, usually money, but you aren't required to pay if you cannot. You may give thanks in other ways, with objects or labor.
## Farming
Farmers on the [[Elestian Continent]] need to use majik to maintain their crops, since it's far too harsh there. Massive greenhouses are built into the ground to benefit from ground insulation, their glass roofs are cleared from snow and ice usually multiple times a day. The rooms are heated with extra large [[Elestian Spatial Heaters]].
## Discovery
The people of Elestal have an urge to discover new ways to make life better. As such, many people are inventors, and nearly anyone who isn't an inventor for work is one as a hobby. This culture produces many inventions, some good, and most not so good. But volume is the name of the game to make something great. Elestal sells their ideas to companies around the world who try to make money from them. Stealing would be a big problem if Elestal was on a different continent, and if they kept the details of the inventions and ideas they sold. They destroy any recorded details of a product after selling it. Only the credited inventor, it's ID number, and it's original title. The inventor is given 20% of the profits from the invention auction.
# Industry
Elestal has a few different industries, but not a lot of diversity.
## Ice Mining
The ice that covers the [[Elestian Continent]] has a very high majik content. The deeper ice has a higher majik content than ice near the surface, so mining of the deep ice and bringing it to the surface is an industry that keeps many people alive. Being near deep ice supports one's majik recovery. And considering most Elestian people use majik to keep from freezing, they are constantly using their majik. Elestian children learn how to do this when they are very young, and people do it subconsciously. It is very difficult to learn how to do this after 19 years of maturity. That is why almost nobody moves into Elestal. The reverse is also true, it is very difficult to learn to not do this once you are 19 years of maturity. An untrained Elestian who goes to the outside world will quickly overheat and expend their majik stores, also known as [[Depletion Sickness]].
