## Chapter 1 Part 1

The sands stretch endlessly on to the suns' ends and the stars' beginning. One lonely pair of boots fall heavy onto the burrowing beetle's drowned carcass that is the Bzor Trail: once a well-traveled route, now quiet. A distant wind reminds the world of its might with a ripping sand-filled howl, but the cave pays no mind. 

The sand, when compared with The Dust, is a caring mother. Loves tough, but always with a feeding hand.
