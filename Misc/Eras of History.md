The history of the world of Airzlinshire can be split into some eras.

# Prehistory

# Era of Awakening

**Span:** 0 -> ~12,000

The Era of Awakening is marked by the discovery and subsequent rise of farming in the [[Gmir River Valley]]. The fertile land allowed for easy farming and higher yields of typically little-producing crops. Because of the fact that forgeable food was so abundant in these areas, the tribes that went through here became less and less migratory over time, eventually settling down in the valley. It was around this time that some people found that they could use majik, no doubt a major factor in their ability to cultivate crops. Majik could be used to both assist in tilling the land (tilling tools did exist, suggesting that majik use was not yet sophisticated enough to do the job on its own), and to aid the plants in their growth. There are many theories as to how the earliest civilizations used majik for farming, many based on the documentation of the practice made later on. With the ability to stay in one place, permanent structures were made, towns, and then cities.

Towards the middle of the Era of Awakening, there was some successful taming of animals. This was primarily started in cities farther away from the main river, likely as a way to get more food as the land there was less fertile than the land along the river's banks. Despite this being the logical motivator, there's evidence that bonds were not uncommonly formed with some animals--domestication for companionship.

With time also came more understanding of majik. It was still very rudimentarily understood, but some cities formed what could be seen as majik guilds or research groups whose goal was to find ways to use this ability that was seemingly embedded in nearly every person in more practical ways. These groups are responsible for nearly all of the majik documentation of the time, and also the very key discovery of how to enrich soil with majik to make plants grow faster.

Eventually, as these areas became more advanced, ideas diffused to other towns and tribes. The cities deep in the [[Gmir River Valley]], those with the largest farms, quickly became rich by selling the seeds of plants that had been selectively bred to be farmable. This caused a trade route to be formed in the [[Eastern Continent]], the legendary [[Knar Road]], which connected many cities together to enable trade. It eventually was built all the way to cities in the southwestern tribes and towns, allowing them to settle down also. With the [[Zwish River Valley]] on the west coast, the towns there started to build boats, and sail to the central continent, one previously uninhabited by people. Slowly, with exploration happening, people started to exist everywhere on the globe.

Later in the Era of Awakening, rudimentary metal working was budding in the eastern regions of the [[Gmir River Valley]]. There's no evidence of heat being used to form, and it was likely all surface copper formed by cold-hammering and used as ornamental pieces.

# Era of Culture

**Span:** ~12,000 -> ~15,000

The Era of Culture is marked by an increase in the importance of culture and art. This was also a time of strong cultural development, farming techniques had been rapidly improving, producing more food, and allowing larger segments of city populations to explore other passions. Art became very important to peoples--especially those in the [[Central Continent]]. Not only visual art, but music, poetry, and performing.

The global trade was lower in this time than the [[Eras of History#Era of Awakening|Era of Awakening]], most communities trying to be more self-sufficient. Patriotism flourished and religion started to become more popular, many rituals around farming and taming are first seen in this era. The taming of a wild animal became a coming of age ritual in some areas in the south of the [[Western Continent]], for example.

# Era of Celestial Accord

**Span:** ~15,000 -> ~16,200

The Era of Celestial accord is marked by a sudden interest in [[Majik]] in cultures of the [[Western Continent]] around [[Myan Kian Lake]]. The was no doubt fueled by the formal discovery of [[Majik#Mixing Elements|element mixing]] in {some city}. There was a growing curiosity about it's true limits and a newfound desire to master [[Majik]], and that "discovery" caused that curiosity to explode. There was a sharp jump in [[Majik]] use in farming, and for the first time, there was a large volume of people trying to use it in their daily life. It became clear that there was more possibility to [[Majik]] than originally thought. The excitement slowly spread to the world over 50-150 years. The spread was slow because of the lack of international trade from the [[Eras of History#Era of Culture|Era of Culture]], especially overseas.

Numerous [[Majik]] research groups, societies, and schools of different types were formed. There was discovery after discovery being made, as governments started pouring a plethora of resources into [[Majik]] research. There was a premium put on education at this time, often times success was defined by one's level of education. In many places, it was common for *all* children to go to a public school to learn [[Majik]]. Of course, this was not general education, but it is the foundation of it. Research was slow in the early parts of this era as there was no real rhyme or reason to it. Nobody could be sure of another's testing and so each group had to do every experiment to verify it. The quality control was also not very good, many researchers not having any training. That's to be expected for the first real scientific discoveries, though. Much research is poorly, or not at all, documented, and there were no standards to speak of. It wasn't until around 15650 that 3 competing standards were developed and then not until 15790 that one of them became *the* global set of standards--at lest for the most part--for scientific research, testing, documenting, and reporting results. 

The global trade gradually picked up again as people realized that they would make more discoveries if they communicated, but the strong language barriers made this difficult. Thankfully, it was early in this era that [[Majel]] was made and spread fast. The slow climb of trade volume seeing a massive jump. With a lingua franca, transportation speed and cost were the only major barriers for traveling overseas. New discoveries in [[Majik]] application, specifically [[Proposal for Majik-based sail propulsion|this study]] and ones inspired by it, were decreasing travel time, and other discoveries about using [[Majik]] to make boats were decreasing the cost of doing so. The world was becoming very much more connected.

The discovery of simple metal forming came about near the end of this era, and it was a heavily [[Majik]]-based process. There was still little use for much of the metal, as really only copper was used and the formed items were fairly crude. Overall, it was only used for simple tools like hammers, and there was little interest in it with [[Majik]] research afoot.

# Era of Mastery

**Span:** ~16,200 -> ~18,600

The Era of Mastery is marked by the slowing of discoveries from the [[Eras of History#Era of Celestial Accord|Era of Celestial Accord]], and the maturing of [[Majik]]. As the frenzy of new things died out, there was a cultural shift in how people viewed [[Majik]], starting to see it more as an art form that can be mastered. [[Majik]] research institutions and societies were replaced by temples, [[Majik]] schools focused on teaching it as an art, and no longer did nearly all children get an education unless they specifically went to learn and master [[Majik]]. Social status started to shift away from education and towards one's [[Majik]] ability and power. The world started to revolve more and more around [[Majik]], and it became commonplace in nearly every aspect of life. New discoveries were seldom shared with the world.

This idea of mastery spread past [[Majik]] and into farming and other trades. Farming in particular saw deep innovations: sophisticated irrigation systems, using [[Majik]] to finely tune the land and environment, and other techniques. Metallurgy also saw innovation with the discovery of iron in the later parts of this era. Refined [[Majik]] techniques allowed for very precise and useful tools to be made out of copper, bronze, and importantly, iron.

Many call this "The Second Era of Culture" because of the similar way that communities started to focus inward, indeed, the booming global trade slowed it's pace from the end of the [[Eras of History#Era of Celestial Accord|Era of Celestial Accord]], but it was still going fairly strong. The dip was nowhere near the extreme during the [[Eras of History#Era of Culture|Era of Culture]]. Travel was cheap enough for those who make a small amount of money to--albeit with much investment--to travel overseas, and the trips were not very long, so there were always at least farmers looking for a new life somewhere else.

# Era of Wars

**Span:** ~18,600 -> ~20,800

The Era of Wars is marked by cultures becoming increasingly different. The world had been in a relatively harmonious state for a very long time, but as populations started to really grow near the end of the [[Eras of History#Era of Mastery|Era of Mastery]], 

the invention of [[Tomes]]. They were not immediately impactful, staying mostly an little-known idea for nearly 150 years after their conception.

Here’s a possible timeline of eras for Airzlinshire—a framework that feels rooted in deep myth yet remains accessible and resonant:

### 1. The Verdant Genesis  
In the earliest mists of time, before recorded history, the world of Airzlinshire is said to have come into being amid vibrant, living energies. This era is one of mythic creation, where the six species were first "awakened" by the ambient pulse of majik. Ancient legends recount that a cosmic communion—akin to a sculptor’s initial stroke on raw marble—set into motion the inherent majik within every living being, including the delicate balance of reproduction where one partner becomes the host. Ritual sites, mysterious monolithic structures, and natural sanctuaries across all four continents serve as faded memorials of this time of raw possibility.  

### 2. The Age of Awakening  
Over time, subtle currents of majik began to stir within individuals, though its potential lay dormant until a spirit of discovery rose among the peoples of Airzlinshire. In this era, wise elders and daring experimenters began to sense and manipulate elemental majik in rudimentary ways. The discovery was neither magical spell nor incantation but the learned, disciplined manipulation of latent energy. Communities began to document their observations, and early schools—perhaps more like informal guilds or circles of thought—emerged, dedicated to understanding how to shape matter with majik. This period laid the intellectual and cultural foundation that would later bloom into sophisticated majik arts.  

### 3. The Age of Celestial Accord  
As the newfound mastery over majik spread, the peoples of the east, central, and west continents began to forge deeper alliances. Trade and cultural exchanges flourished along mystical trade routes where even the frosty isolation of the north was not immune to majik’s call. Remarkable feats, such as magically powered vessels gliding over vast waters and floating towns anchored in airy majik fields, became symbols of unity. This era witnessed the early harmonization of art, science, and majik—a genuine celebration of the creative spirit, much like a communal sculpture taking shape from shared visions and values.  

### 4. The Age of Elemental Mastery  
During this golden period, the inherent potential of the 11 elements was systematically explored and codified. Magnanimous academies and secretive sanctums were established across the continents, where masters refined precise techniques—a practice as rigorous as any artisan’s pursuit of perfection. Here, majik was no longer seen as a mysterious force but as a skill honed by discipline, imagination, and the quiet interplay of nature’s building blocks. Innovations abounded: intricate devices moved by majik, ceremonial constructs floating as symbols of cultural pride, and even constructs that hinted at an elegant integration of the natural and the contrived—all without betraying the world’s delicate balance.  

### 5. The Age of Discordant Convergence  
No era of progress is without its shadow, and here comes a period marked by ideological schisms and ambition-fueled strife. Diverging interpretations of majik’s purpose led to conflicts among species and between regions of the sprawling continents. Some sought to harness majik purely for power—transforming once-beautiful constructs into symbols of dominion—while others held fast to its creative, life-affirming origins. Battles were waged not only on physical battlegrounds but in the intellectual realm, with ancient guilds, clashing philosophies of host versus non-host roles, and divergent visions of progress. This tumult, however, would set the stage for a deeper understanding of majik’s dual nature.  

### 6. The Epoch of Harmonized Renewal  
In the aftermath of discord, as the wounds of conflict slowly healed, a great synthesis began to emerge. Societies reconsidered the true essence of majik—as both a conduit for creation and a mirror to the soul. This era is characterized by mindful reconstruction, where the art of world-building becomes a shared, almost sacred endeavor. Creative energies converge as artisans, philosophers, and majik practitioners reforge alliances across species and continents, celebrating majik’s transformative power through breathtaking architecture, art, and a refined balance of tradition and innovation. Airzlinshire steps into an age of perpetual creative possibility—its history an ever-unfolding masterpiece sculpted by the collaborative efforts of its diverse peoples.  


Each of these eras provides a distinct flavor to Airzlinshire’s history while echoing the timeless rhythm of discovery, conflict, mastery, and renewal that resonates with us all. As you further develop Airzlinshire, consider delving into how each continent's unique environment and the specialized traits of the six species influenced the interpretation and use of majik. For instance, perhaps on the north continent, snowy majik principles gave rise to a culture of ephemeral, fleeting yet beautiful art forms that contrast sharply with the deep, earthbound majik of the central lands. Such interplays can deepen the relevance of the eras and encourage collaborators to explore myriad narrative threads.

### Early Proto-Civilization: Laying the Foundations

**Era: The Age of Awakening**

- **Farming & Sedentary Life:** As communities began to form from the nomadic wanderings of species emerging from the mythical Verdant Genesis, the practical need for steady nourishment drove early settlers to experiment with tending wild growth. Instead of a simple plow and seed story, early agricultural practices in Airzlinshire intertwined with majik. Pioneers learned that by gently “nudging” the elemental energy in the soil at certain seasons, wild crops could yield more abundant harvests. Over time, these rudimentary rituals evolved into a systematic method of farming—one where the rhythm of nature and the pulse of majik were inseparable.
    
- **Animal Taming & Companionship:** Standing alongside proto-farming, the taming of wild beasts wasn’t just a matter of domestication for labor or companionship. Early settlers discovered that many indigenous animals—imbued with their own traces of majik—could be coaxed into symbiotic relationships. These early experiments might have involved subtle rituals that aligned an animal’s inherent majik with that of its human companion. This set the stage for animals not just as work partners but also as spiritual allies whose unique magics could support farming, transport, or even early trades.
    
- **Primitive Metal Work:** While wild ecosystems dominated, the discovery of native mineral veins was already in play. Early versions of metal use were likely very rudimentary—perhaps cold-hammered ores used for basic tools or ornamental objects—and occasionally groomed by accidental exposure to ambient majik. These occurrences would hint at metal’s potential but not yet transform society. In many traditions, these early metallic finds were often woven into myth and ritual, seen as gifts from the spirit of the land rather than mere resources to be exploited.
    

_In summary, the Age of Awakening is the backdrop against which settlers begin to experiment with harnessing majik for practical needs—transforming foraging and gathering cultures into sedentary communities that blend natural growth with intentional cultivation._

### Flourishing Knowledge and Cross-Pollination

**Era: The Age of Celestial Accord**

- **Advances in Farming:** As long-distance trade and cultural exchange intensified among the eastern, central, and western continents, agricultural practices diversified. Cosmopolitan hubs emerged where environmental challenges necessitated refined, region-specific techniques. For instance, in one region the delicate art of incorporating seasonal energy shifts into crop cycles became ritualized, while across the sea a seemingly more “organic” method evolved—where farmers learned to read a plant’s subtle response to ambient majik pulses. These practices gave each area a signature culinary and agricultural identity.
    
- **Refined Animal Taming Traditions:** The interconnected trade routes also provided platforms for sharing techniques and legends about animal bonds. Bestiaries recorded the taming of certain majik-infused beasts—creatures whose very presence could alter the flow of majik through a community’s land. Each tale hinted that successful domestication wasn’t a brute force conquest of nature, but a delicate dance of mutual attunement. Ceremonies evolved where a potential companion and its future master would undergo symbolic rites meant to calibrate their majik together, ensuring a lifelong bond.
    
- **Early Metallurgy with Majik Influences:** Now with an appetite for both creation and collaboration, forging metal began its transformation from incidental curiosities into purposeful craft. Early smiths and alchemists, inspired by the interplay of the 11 elemental energies, started experimenting with controlled heat and majik-guided smelting. Metals such as copper and early iron alloys—when bathed in the ambient energies of majik—showed unusual qualities like increased malleability or a natural resonance with elemental energies. Although not industrial in any modern sense, these innovations set a foundation for a metallurgy that was as much an art form as a technology.
    

_In the Age of Celestial Accord, communication between regions encourages innovation to travel, mature, and differentiate. Farming, taming, and metalwork are now seen not merely as survival techniques but as cultural crafts enriched with majik._

### Mastered Integration and Innovation

**Era: The Age of Elemental Mastery**

- **Sophisticated Agricultural Systems:** By this time, agriculture had grown to embrace both tradition and innovation. Great academies of natural arts and majik now taught how to “tune” the land, much as one might tune a delicate instrument. Farmers became as much stewards of the land’s majik as cultivators of soil—introducing crop rotation systems that accounted for seasonal majik flows, the manipulation of certain elemental energies to fend off blight, and even ceremonial festivals to honor nature’s cyclic rebirth.
    
- **Noble Animal Partnerships:** Animal taming entered a refined phase. With dedicated schools and traditions, the process shifted from trial and improvisation to a disciplined art form. Masters in animal lore even identified particular species whose majik potentials were ideally suited for different roles—be it for transportation, guardianship, or ritual partnership in catalyzing larger communal magical events. Their techniques were passed down as sacred knowledge, ensuring that each domesticated beast was not only a work companion but a living archive of majik’s enduring spirit.
    
- **Majik-Enhanced Metallurgy:** The true potential of metals was unlocked during this epoch. Craftsmen discovered that certain ores, when exposed to focused majik energy during smelting, could yield alloys with properties unattainable through conventional means. Some metals were found to conduct majik energy more efficiently, becoming prized for ceremonial armaments, tools, or even as core components in the delicate operations of majik-operated machines. These innovations spurred a new wave of creative expression—each piece of metalwork carried a signature of its maker’s skill and their communion with the elemental forces.
    

_The Age of Elemental Mastery represents the perfect synthesis of practical need, disciplined study, and artistic aspiration—a stage where agriculture, animal taming, and the art of metalwork become pillars of a matured society that prizes both beauty and function._

### Later Refinements and Cultural Legacies

Even as the world moved into the turbulent Age of Discordant Convergence and later into the Epoch of Harmonized Renewal, these early discoveries would undergo further reinterpretation:

- **Agriculture and domestication** methods became not only practical but emblematic of a society’s identity, interwoven with new majik rituals that recalled ancient rites while embracing modern wisdom.
    
- **Metallurgy** became a symbol of both technological prowess and spiritual artistry, with relics and artifacts crafted in these earlier eras taking on revered, almost legendary status.
    

_In these later periods, the collective memory of when and how these discoveries were made became a shared lore—a reminder that even the most everyday practices are steeped in the majik of Airzlinshire._
