Elestian Spatial Heaters are devices designed by Elestian researchers to heat buildings. It is a heat dissipator attached to an object with a high thermal mass and a [[Tomes|tome]] that heats the mass. They can be found in nearly every building in [[Elestal Kingdom|Elestal]] They usually have insulation around the mass to protect people from accidentally burning themselves on contact. The mass is often made of a dense stone, and the heat dissipator, packed conductive metal rods or plates to obtain high surface area. They require occasional activation, the interval depending on the specifications of the device and the desired temperature.

The mass is needed since [[Tomes]] are fast releasing, but heat needs to be constant.
