# Who are the Monus Tome Monks?
The Royal Order of the Tome Monks is a partner organization of theÂ [[Monus Kingdom]]. The order does not work under the kingdom, despite being called "royal", but works with it in partnership. They however do have a very close partnership, and take action with the best interest of the other organization in mind.

The Order is comprised of monks and their purpose is to make [[Tomes]] for the [[Monus Kingdom]]. Monus' power comes from the making of tomes, and being the only kingdom that can make them. The process of fabricating tomes is a heavily guarded secret by the Order. Tomes are an extremely [[Monus Kingdom#Exports|important industry]] for Monus.
# Research
The Tome Monks are also in charge of researching tomes. They have put a lot of resources into researching what a tome is. All of this research is top secret and only researchers have access to it.
# Monk Training
> [!NOTE]
> All ages are adjusted to their equivalent in human terms. It is their developmental age. Different peoples will have different maturity curves (rates).

Tome Monks are trained from a young age, they usually start around 9 years old. They are taken to [[Upper Monus#North Upper Monus|North Upper Monus]] for schooling. In this schooling they are isolated from the rest of the world. Rarely seeing their family, once every 8 days, their instructor becomes like a parent to them even more than their real parents. They are allowed to message back and forth with their family, but all incoming and outgoing messages are filtered. All of them are rewritten to include only some details, and to obfuscate the writing style of both the monk and their family.
# Culture
The Tome Monks have a culture that is a subset of [[Monus Kingdom|Monus]] culture. There are some traditions and rituals that are specific to them, though as all Tome Monks are citizens of [[Monus Kingdom|Monus]], most follow the typical Monus traditions as well.
## Special Events
There are some natural events and holidays that are important to the Tome Monks' culture.
### The Night of Colored Mist
The Night of Colored Mist is a naturally occurring event on the tops of The [[Monus Mountains]]. When it gets cold enough, majik mist will form at the peaks of the mountains. This only ever happens at night. Though there is a story of the Colored Mist appearing during the midday, an occurrence of this has not been reliably recorded.

During this event, Tome Monks usually travel as high up the mountain they can to pray and breathe in the mist. Many Monks will then dance and play with majik all night. This is one of their few breaks, and the majik mist is quite energizing. The next day is always a day off to rest from the night of play.
### Birthday
On a Tome Monk's birthday, they get 3 days off work: one day before and after to go and see their family.
