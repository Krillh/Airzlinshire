#OldGvar

Old Gvar was the primary spoken language of the [[Gmarpshin]] people.


# Sentence Construction
## Parts of speech
There are 6 parts of speech in Old Gvar. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, conjunctions, and particles.
- Nouns: a person, place, or thing.
- Verbs: an action of some sort.
- Adjectives: modifies or adds to the meaning of a noun *or* adjective.
- Prepositions: describes how an object relates to a verb.
- Conjunctions:  divide a sentence into 2 clauses and describes the connection between them.
- Particles: mark different parts of sentences, create emphasis, or mark questions.
## SVO
Old Gvar is SVO (Subject, Verb, Object). This means that the subject comes before the verb, then the object.
$$\underbrace{\text{mark}}_{\text{subject}}\;\underbrace{\text{wants}}_{verb}\;\text{a }\underbrace{\text{pear}}_{\text{object}}$$
Direct and indirect object are marked with particles so their order isn't strictly defined, but typically the indirect object is first.
## Clauses
Clauses in Gvar must have a subject, verb, and object, following [[Old Gvar#SVO|SVO]] ordering. Certain parts may be omitted for various reasons, but they must exist in it's meaning.
- The object may be omitted if the verb is reflexive (when the subject is also the object). In this case, the verb is marked as so with a particle.
- The object may be omitted in informal settings when it is the same as the previous sentence and it is clear that that is the case. ( You peel the banana. I eat *\[ the banana \]*. ).
- The subject may be omitted if context makes it clear what it is, or if it is the same as the previous sentence. ( You peel the banana. *\[ You \]* eat the peel. ).
One sentence can have multiple clauses if you use a conjunction to connect two of them together. The conjunction makes the second clause into a dependent clause that modifies the previous clause.
## Phrases
In Gvar, there isn't really a concept of phrases. The different sections of a clause are usually marked with words, particles, or suffixes. The only things to note are that adjectives come before the word (or group of words) they modify.
## Putting Together a Sentence
When making a sentence, you start with a subject. This is the person, place, thing, or idea that you want to describe. After that, you add the subject marker /e/. Now you need a verb, something that the subject is doing. If it is a reflexive verb, end it with the particle /oe/, otherwise end it with /o/. If the verb is not reflexive, you need an object.
