> Meta talk about various inspirations:
> The script was inspired a lot by Korean scripts, at least in concept. They also use an abugida, though it is a bit more complicated. The idea of open syllables was from Japanese, and the idea of root words from the Chinese family of languages. The concept of suffixes is partially inspired from PIE (Proto-Indo-European).

| Close-mid |       |     | ɤ(u) |

# Script

The main script for Majel is simply called the Majel Script. It is a phonetic abugida. Each character is made up of 2 parts, the top part (the consonant) and the bottom (the vowel). No other consonant part is needed as all syllables in Majel are either CV or CVV (one consonant then one or two vowels).
## Voiced / Unvoiced Change
With consonants that have both the voiced and unvoiced variant present in the phonology, the voiced variant of the consonant has a vertical stroke on the left side of the character. The stroke falls through the vowel section of the character, making the consonant surround the left side of the vowel along with whatever other sides are covered by the unvoiced consonant.
# Parts of Speech
# Root Words
With the 16 main consonants and 5 vowels, you can make 80 syllables of the CV format. These syllables are called the "mono root words", or simply, "mono roots". They are also called group 1 roots. Each one has a definition, and all words are derived in one way or another from these root words, except the words themselves of course.
## Group 2 Roots
Group 2 roots are derived from group 1 roots by means of vowel movement. Each mono root has 1 vowel, and each vowel has 2 ways it can be transformed into a group 2 root. The vowel movement rules describe which diphthongs are allowed to be derived from which vowels.
- a -> ia | ua
- i -> ai | ei
- u -> au | iu
- e -> ie | ue
- o -> oi | ou

The definitions of group 2 roots are usually fairly close to that of the mono root it came from.
# Syntax
Majel follows a strict "Subject Verb Object" (SVO) word ordering.
