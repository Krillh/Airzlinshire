## Sentence Structure
The sentence order in Majel is the same as English's, subject-verb-object (SOV). This means that every sentence starts with the subject, who's doing something, then the verb, what that subject is doing, then the object associated with that action. 

## Parts Of Speech
In Majel, there are 5 parts speech: Nouns, verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, and particles. Nouns are the subjects and objects of a sentence. Verbs are action words. Conjunctions connect words together in a meaningful way, these are things like 'and' and 'or'. Particles are words that modify the meaning of the whole sentence. An example is, there's a particle that signifies that the sentence is a question about whatever word is next. Finally, adjectives, specifically in Majel, are words that modify a noun or verb. Unlike in English, the same part of speech is used to modify both nouns and verbs.
### Word Forms
There are 3 word forms: root form, verb form, and adjective form.
