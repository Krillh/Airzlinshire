#Majik

At the core, majik is something between matter and energy. It is both, in a way. It can be used as energy, but it can also have mass and take up space and can be moved by energy. In fact, it can be manipulated by the very energy that it is.
# Elements
There is only 1 real element of majik. All the "elements" are just different frequencies of majik energy. Not all types of majik correspond to a unique frequency, either. Both [[Light Majik|light]] and [[Dark Majik|dark]] majik affect the heat and light frequency, just in different ways.
# Majik Materialization
> [!note]
> The fact that majik can appear as matter is well known by the people of [[Airzlinshire]], but the idea of ethyr and the specifics are unknown.

Majik has the capacity to materialize into a matter form under some circumstances. It can exist in the 3 basic states of matter, solid, liquid, & gas. It typically exists in a 4th state called ethyr (EH-thr). In the ethyr state, it doesn't interact with the world itself, but it can be manipulated and the matter that is in the same physical space will be affected. That is what [[Majik Manipulations|majik manipulation]] is. Majik will, at a certain temperature and/or pressure, materialize into gas. Then it can undergo condensation or deposition into liquid or solid forms, respectively. When gaseous majik goes to ethyr, this is called ethyrization.

Materialized majik is not found in nature except in the coldest environments or places under extreme pressure.

## Gaseous Majik And The Tome Monks
The [[The Royal Order of the Monus Tome Monks|Tome Monks]] live at the top of [[The Monus Mountains]], a place where majik is constantly materialized into a gas. The monks breathe in the gaseous majik and it ethyrizes in their bodies, causing them to absorb the majik energy. Even sometimes it gets so cold that the majik condenses into a mist. This is what makes [[The Royal Order of the Monus Tome Monks#The Night of Colored Mist|The Night of Colored Mist]].

When someone breathes in gaseous majik, the higher temperature inside the body makes it ethyrize and absorb into the person.

## The Problem
If a person can only manipulate majik, and make lattices, through having a complete dynamic lattice, how did people get a lattice to begin with? This problem of origin is one yet unsolved. One theory is that there was a majik lattice that makes other lattices and that found it's way into a person at some point. It triggers when someone gives birth, putting one into the child. It is thought that it wasn't perfect and had some random variation and one time, produced a lattice that could also be controlled by the child.
