Depletion Sickness (Majik Depletion Sickness) is when someone uses all or nearly all their majik stores. Common symptoms include:
- Loss of consciousness
- Extreme lack of energy / tiredness
- Fatigue
- Lowered body temperature

When someone has depletion sickness, a good long rest, often 10 to 20 hours depending on one's majik capacity, is usually enough to fully recover. Though, it has been found that exposure to deep ice from Elestal can hugely expedite the recovery timeline. After waking, most people experience some tiredness and fatigue for 24 hours.
