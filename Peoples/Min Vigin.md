Min Vigin are very pacifist type of people. They are about 1.4 meters (4.5 feet) tall and live for roughly 170 years. Min Vigins often live in houses made into the ground or in tree houses. Very few Min Vigins live in towns and cities. Although, the houses of those who do live in towns are often filled with plants and, if they can, animals. Most Min Vigins that work are merchants of spices and rare herbs, since they have great knowledge of the forests. Min Vigins that do work usually chose to care for people in a hospital or become botanists. Min Vigins are quiet and timid, rarely speaking up. But, whenever they do, it's often important.

Min Vigins often pick up [[Life Majik]] from a young age, not needing much instruction other than observation. Most Min Vigins feel close to nature and don't pick up another element, sticking with [[Life Majik]]. Because they often learn it from a young age, lots of Min Vigins become quite adept at using [[Life Majik]].
## Maturity Curves
Their physical maturity curve closely resembles the function: $$A(x)=0.1003x+40.8013\log\left(0.2x+1\right)$$

It's derivative being: $$A'(x)=\frac{0.02006x+3.644256}{0.2x+1}$$

Min Vigin age quicker than standard until 14.7 years (of time). They are 25.7 years old (maturity) at the time. Then they age slower and slower than standard, reaching 80 years (maturity) at 170 years (time).

Their mental maturity curve is the same as the physical maturity curve.
