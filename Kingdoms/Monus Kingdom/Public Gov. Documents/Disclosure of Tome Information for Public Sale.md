**Subject**: Disclosure of Tome Information for Public Sale

In accordance with the Kingdom of Monus' commitment to transparency and fair trade, this document outlines the information that will be included on the data sheets accompanying each Tome sold in the market. This information is intended to provide potential buyers with a comprehensive understanding of the Tome's capabilities while preserving the secrecy of the Tome creation process.

**1. Tome Power (PW)**: The calculated power index of the Tome, based on the amount of Majik energy used in each casting, will be included. This is measured in gako.

**2. Tome Capacity (CP)**: The expected number of uses at the Tome's full charge capacity will be included. This is calculated by dividing the actual total Majik capacity, measured in gako, by the power used in each casting, also measured in gako.

**3. Tome Majik Efficiency (ME)**: A measure of how much Majik is used to cast the spell and how much is lost in each casting. Specifics of how this is calculated are classified.

**4. Tome Size Efficiency (SE)**: The density of the Majik when the Tome is fully charged, measured in diako.

**5. Tome Casting Time (CT)**: The amount of time it takes for a Tome to expend a full cast's worth of energy. This is calculated by dividing the Majik power of a cast, measured in gako, by the Majik flow rate of the Tome, measured in seko. The Majik flow rate is dependent on both the material the Tome is made of and classified factors of the manufacturing process.

**6. Tome Spell Complexity (SP)**: A complex measurement calculated by multiplying together one more than the square root of the Majik power for each element. Specifics of how this is used internally are classified.

**7. Material**: The type of material used in the creation of the Tome will be included. However, specifics about how the material contributes to the Tome's capabilities are classified.

**8. Production Time**: The time taken to produce the Tome will be included. However, specifics about how this time period relates to the Tome creation process are classified.

This document is intended to provide a balance between transparency for buyers and the protection of the Kingdom of Monus' proprietary Tome creation process. Any attempt to reverse-engineer the process of Tome creation from this disclosed information is strictly prohibited and punishable by law.
