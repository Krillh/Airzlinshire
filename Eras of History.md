The history of civilization has many eras, each one started by a major shift.

## The Simple Era
The Simple Era spanned from possibly before year 0 to around year 19,968 (.l.. lll. .... ....). The planet had just begun to thaw from the [[Great Ice Age]], allowing people to live out of caves year round. People had just learned how to plant food, and made the first tribes. These peoples were located near the equator on the western coast of the Solus Continent. Over time, as the world thawed more, they migrated north and south.
## The Copper Era
The Copper Era extends from roughly 19,968 to 22016 (.l.l .ll. .... ....). The discovery of copper was groundbreaking, and altered society heavily. Over the course of 2048 (.l.. .... ....) years, copper was used to make tools, weapons, some structures, and much more.

## The Metals Era
The discovery of Bronze and Iron happened in quick succession, both of them around year 22016. Bronze was much better for working than copper, and it was stronger, so people switched as quickly as they could. Iron was even stronger, but was a massive pain to work, so it's use was not as quickly taken on. Iron was also very difficult to find as the only places known at the time to have it were the [[Windy Cliffs]].
