# Sentence Construction
## Parts of speech
There are 8 primary parts of speech in Old Gvar. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, conjunctions, particles, sentence relators, and combinators.
- Nouns: a person, place, or thing.
- Verbs: an action of some sort.
- Adjectives: modifies or adds to the meaning of a noun *or* adjective.
- Prepositions: describes how an object relates to a verb.
- Conjunctions:  divide a sentence into 2 clauses and describes the connection between them.
- Particles: mark different parts of sentences, create emphasis, or mark questions.
- Sentence Relators (SRs): separate sentences and describe how two sentences connect.
- Combinators: apply binary or unary logic, most often linking things (ie "and", "or", "not")
## SVO
Old Gvar is SVO (Subject, Verb, Object). This means that the subject comes before the verb, then the object. Here's an example in English:
$$\underbrace{\text{Mark}}_{\text{subject}}\;\underbrace{\text{wants}}_{verb}\;\text{a }\underbrace{\text{pear}}_{\text{object}}.$$
The direct object always goes first since indirect objects always have a preposition.
## Clauses
Clauses in Gvar must have a subject, verb, and object, following [[Old Gvar#SVO|SVO]] ordering. Certain parts may be omitted for various reasons, but they must exist in it's meaning.
- The object may be omitted if the verb is reflexive (when the subject is also the object). In this case, the verb is marked as so with a particle.
- The object may be omitted in informal settings when it is the same as the previous sentence and it is clear that that is the case. ( You peel the banana. I eat *\[ the banana \]*. ).
- The subject may be omitted if context makes it clear what it is, or if it is the same as the previous sentence. ( You peel the banana. *\[ You \]* eat the peel. ).
One sentence can have multiple clauses if you use a conjunction to connect two of them together. The conjunction makes the second clause into a dependent clause that modifies the previous clause.
## Phrases
In Gvar, there isn't really a concept of phrases. The different sections of a clause are usually marked with words, particles, or suffixes. The only things to note are that adjectives come before the word (or group of words) they modify.
## Putting Together a Sentence
When making a clause, you start with a subject. This is the person, place, thing, or idea that you want to describe. After that, you add the subject marker /e/. Now you need a verb, something that the subject is doing. If it is a reflexive verb, end it with the particle /oe/, otherwise end it with /o/. If the verb is not reflexive, you need an object. This can be nearly anything, including another clause. If the object is not direct, you must use a preposition before it. You may add as many prepositions and objects as you like. Then, if you wish, you may add a conjunction and start a dependent clause. This is the same process as the independent clause now.

**Example:**
/pan e ksevi o bil s dvavi o pasha kan/
- pan - n. the self
- e - subject marker
- ksevi - v. need
- o - typical verb marker
- bil - n. helper (direct object because of the lack of preposition)
- s - conjunction meaning "for" or "to", indicating reason, or purpose
- dvavi - v. carry. Notice, there is no subject in the dependent clause because it's clear though context who the subject is (the helper)
- o - typical verb marker
- pasha - a. my
- kan - n. basket

All together, the sentence translates to: "I need a helper to carry my basket".

## Dropping (Omitting) Parts of Clauses
There are times when either the subject, verb, or object of a clause is omitted. This is covered briefly in the [[Old Gvar#Clauses|clauses]] section, but there is more detail to it. For the subject, there are 2 primary cases where this happens. First, if the subject is the same as the previous sentence or clause. In this case, the subject marker /e/ stays to indicate this. The other case is when the subject is known by context. This often overwrites the first case, making the subject marker /e/ dropped also. [[Old Gvar#Example 1|This]] is a very good example of context-based subject dropping.

Verbs are rarely dropped on their own, but in the case that one wants to be poetic and mildly confusing, you can drop the verb, leaving the verb marker /o/ or /oe/. This can only happen when the verb is the same as the previous sentence or clause.

The only normal time when the direct object is dropped from a clause is when the verb is reflexive. The verb is marked with /oe/ instead of /o/ and that's all there is. Indirect objects don't get dropped.
## Sentence Relators
Sentence relators are a special type of word that gets inserted between sentences to both split them and describe how they are related to each other. All SRs start with the /h/ phoneme. Some common ones are:
- han: related idea + unspecified relative time
- haf: related + before
- haz: related + simultaneous
- hash: related + after
- hur: end of paragraph or idea
- hef: caused by (because)
- hesh: causes (and so)
- hon: contrasting (contrarily, however)
## Forming Questions
To turn a sentence into a question, add one (or more if combined with combinators) question markers (particles) to the beginning of a sentence, even before the subject. All question markers start with /hi/.
- hin: what
- hil: who
- hitfon: when (specifically)
- hitfor: when (era / period)
- hikfen: why
- hitshon: where
- hipshin: how

For example, you could say, /hipshin pin e tasi o pnin/ -> how did you do that? When speaking, question markers usually have a falling tone. This is the only consistent example of tone in [[Old Gvar]].
# Phonology
Old Gvar originally used the following consonants in IPA: p, b, t, d, k, g, ɸ, β, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, x, m, n, l, ɻ. However, because some consonant clusters are difficult to say, there were a few rapid phonological changes. The language after these minor consonant shifts is considered to be the real Old Gvar since the period before them was so short-lived. The cluster changes are as follows:
- \[tl\] -> \[sl\]
- \[dl\] -> \[zl\]
- \[tʃ\] -> \[t͡ʃ\]
- \[dʒ\] -> \[d͡ʒ\]
- \[tɻ\] -> \[tj\] (ty)
- \[dɻ\] -> \[dj\] (dy)

Old Gvar also has vowels. It uses the following vowels (in IPA): u, o, a, e, i. 

## Romanization
The consonants in Old Gvar are Romanized as follows:
p - p
b - b
t - t
d - d
k - k
g - g
f - ɸ
v - β
s - s
z - z
q (sh) - ʃ
j - ʒ
h - x
m - m
n - n
l - l
r - ɻ
