The Monus Kingdom is the smallest kingdom of the 7 by land. But are the 4th most populous.

# Culture
The Monus culture is one of quietness and respect. There is a strict social hierarchy a large wealth gap. Someone of lower status is easy to pick out from their clothes, and they must pay respects to those of higher status. Blues and purples are important colors, and swirls are considered the most beautiful shape.
## Wealth & Power Gap
In Monus, there is an extremely large wealth and power gap. The lowest class makes up about 88% of the population. They are all the working class and live in poor, but livable conditions. They get to enjoy comforts like markets, entertainment, sturdy housing, warmth, and enough money to make it by without starving. Water is also a free commodity, offered at various wells in towns. Most houses have packed dirt flooring, and beds are raised and made of a scratchy, but fluffy material that is harvested from a specific species of bush. Overall, this working class is not a terrible state of being, but is so incredibly different from the life of even the next highest class.

The next class, tome merchants, make up roughly 9% of the population. They often don't have much in terms of real estate in the actual borders of Monus, maybe only a High House. They usually live primarily near their sale location of choice. Many live in [[Solus Kingdom|Solus]] as it's the largest importer of [[Tomes]]. For most merchants, selling takes much more time, as most don't sell to another distributer. Specifically when selling to Solus. The Solus Kingdom has very specific laws on the importing of goods.

The upper class makes up the remaining 3% of the population. Their real estate is spread out over [[Upper Monus]]. The upper class is made up of well documented [[Upper Class Families of Monus|families]]. Most families are heads of some organization, and lots of those are outside of Monus. Many came to Monus generations ago to live in a safe place away from assassination attempts. Since then, lots of families have become immersed in Monus' culture. 
## Clothes
People of lower status usually wear rough sewn cloaks and drapes as they are easy to make. In warmer times of year, it is common to wear a skirt-like piece and a top piece that resembles a short cloak. This usually leaves the lower middle exposed. Leather shoes are common, and most people wear hoods, not hats.

People in the merchant class usually have fitted clothes, but not mad of fancy material. They do a lot of traveling around the world and that is not a clean activity. Their clothes also are frequently folded up and packed away, and so being made out of thin material is useful, so it can pack away smaller. This is less useful for their travel clothes, which usually consist of a loose, long skirt; a fitted top, usually long-sleeve; and a short-brimmed hat. Selling outfits often include thin fitted pants and thin suit-like tops. These are usually blue and/or purple. Swirl decorations are common.

People from the upper classes often wear fitted clothes, as they can afford it. Blues, purples, and golds are the dominating colors of choice. It is common for people to wear headpieces to show their status within some family or organization. These sometimes resemble crowns or tiaras, but can be hats or other ornamental headwear.
## Work Ethic
In Monus, there is a strong sense of loyalty and dedication to one's work. The expectation is always quality first. If a poor product is produced, it is thrown away as it would be an embarrassment to display such poor work.

It is normal, and expected, that one put work above family, except in dire situations. Though, most work in family-run businesses, as that is the norm. Big companies never made it far in Monus, as quality over quantity is not very scalable.
## Majik
[[Dark Majik]] is the primary element in Monus, with most people having some affiliation with it.
# Industry
By far, production and exporting of [[Tomes]] is the lifeline of Monus' industry. The method for fabricating tomes and nearly everything about them is held secret by the kingdom as to maintain a monopoly. There have been many attempts to steal the secret from them, but to no avail.

Roughly 20% of the population is employed in tome material mining. The [[Monus Mountains]] are mined to obtain stones for [[Tomes|tome]] making. It is a low yield operation, especially when it is all done by hand.
## Tome Monopoly
To maintain a monopoly on [[Tomes]], Monus has 2 tricks. They keep the manufacturing of it a secret, and they have the only known source of the primary material for making tomes. They have multiple ways that they keep the manufacturing a secret: they have a culture of honor and the idea of leaving something that you dedicate to is preposterous, they keep their [[The Royal Order of the Monus Tome Monks|Tome Monks]] in Upper Monus under surveillance like a prison, and they keep those who are trained to be [[The Royal Order of the Monus Tome Monks|Tome Monks]] uneducated about the outside world.

These 2 tricks would seem to be not enough to maintain a monopoly, as one leak would crumble the whole operation. But, there is one more thing. Not a trick, but purely a fact of geography, the tops of [[Monus Mountains]] have the unique feature of replenishing one's majik stores at astonishing rates. This is one of the things that the [[The Royal Order of the Monus Tome Monks|Tome Monks]] harness to make [[Tomes]].
## Natural Resources
There are few natural resources for the Monus Kingdom to collect as the kingdom occupies a very small space, geographically, and had a very high population density. They are surrounded by extremely tall mountains and so they cannot expand their land. They do get fish from the Great Monus River that runs through the whole kingdom. It is rich in fish as it has a high concentration of [[Life Majik]].

The land is not suitable for growing food as they have very high population density, so nearly all food is imported.
## Artisans
There is a large portion of the population that works as artisans. In Monus, just being an artisan is not regarded highly, and most artisans are lower class. Artisans make everything from clay pots to clothes, with a focus on quality over quantity. Since it is in the Monus culture to produce quality work, nearly every product from Monus is considered artisanal.
## Trade
The primary model for trade in Monus is a mix of stores, mostly for local trading, and weekly markets, for global goods. The weekly selling market is mainly for merchants who buy goods from people and then sell them to the rest of the world, and the weekly buying market is for merchants to sell goods from the rest of the world. The selling market is 2 days before the buying market. Both of these are all-day events, starting at 4:00 and usually going to 22:00. It is customary to send one person from the family to buy during the buying market, but for multiple people to go and sell during the selling market. Often the buyer is a child, someone unable to work as much. Though, the contents of the market shifts throughout the day, usually: food in the morning, clothes and household items midday, and weapons in the evening. You don't see many children in the market in the evening.

The markets are set up in various plazas and squares scattered around [[Lower Monus]]. It is busy and bustling all day long as thousands of people are trying to buy and sell goods. People carrying carts and baskets, no animals pulling them as there's no space. It is chaotic, but also everyone is friendly. You see many cases of people helping each other carry items and lots of talking and laughing. It's time for people to socialize.

# History

> [!Note]
> Monus constructed mountains around itself when it was formed to isolate itself from attacks. this has resulted in Upper Monus to become fairly dry in terms of rainfall. Though these mountains have created many new rivers both in and out of the kingdom.
