#Majik #LightMajik

Combinations:
- Light majik + [[Dark Majik]] => [[Gray Majik]]

Light Majik specializes in precise manipulation of thermal energy and light in small quantities. This looks like heating up a small object or making a rock glow. One analogy to consider is that you can apply a great force to a small area with high precision: a high flow rate of a small amount of energy with high precision. This is in contrast to [[Dark Majik]], which also deals with thermal energy and light. A consequence is that congregation of energy is easier with light majik than [[Dark Majik]].

## Cultural Significance

## Military Effectiveness
One of the most common ways to weaponize light majik is to make lasers. This job is well suited for light majik since making light into a thin beam requires high precision, but doesn't require a large amount of energy to make a very powerful beam. Over time, this skill has become so ubiquitous in battle that it gained it's own terminology and it became common for people to specialize in lazing.
## Daily Use
Light majik has various uses that assist in the day-to-day, such as:
- illumination
- lighting flames and intensifying small flames
- maintaining body temperature
- heating or cooling small objects
- cutting and welding metal
