At the core, majik is something between matter and energy. It is both, in a way. It can be used as energy, but it can also have mass and take up space and can be moved by energy. In fact, it can be manipulated by the very energy that it is.
# Elements
There are only 2 real elements (kind of) of majik: elemental majik and corrupt majik. All of the elements are simply different specific frequencies of elemental majik. Even corrupt majik is just elemental majik where the oscillation is rotated 90 degrees about the x axis to oscillate in the z axis.
# Majik Materialization
Majik has the capacity to materialize into a matter form under some circumstances. It can exist in the 3 basic states of matter, solid, liquid, & gas. It typically exists in a 4th state called ethyr (EH-thr). In the ethyr state, it doesn't interact with the world itself, but it can be manipulated and the matter that is in the same physical space will be affected. That is what [[Majik#How do People Use it|majik manipulation]] is. Majik will, at a certain temperature and/or pressure, materialize into gas. Then it can undergo condensation or deposition into liquid or solid forms, respectively. When gaseous majik goes to ethyr, this is called ethyrization.
