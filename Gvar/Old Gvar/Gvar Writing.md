# Traditional Gvar Writing
The traditional writing system for [[Old Gvar]], usually called Traditional Gvar Writing is a a syllabary with some hints of a logographic system. It's the oldest writing system and longest living one, being used throughout most of Gvar's history.
## Principal Roots
Each principal (mono-syllabic) root, other than /h-/ roots, get's it's own full-width character. There are a few reoccurring radicals, like /pe/, the symbol for "person". In fact, that is one of the most common radicals along with half on /pne/, meaning "thing", and an open version of /pne/ to represent a container. Nearly all principal root characters are vaguely ideograms, representing some idea by attempting to visualize it.

These characters only represent the root, however, and most roots are not free morphemes, but bound ones. They need a suffix to be used as a word. Each of these suffixes are added to a principal morpheme by adding a diacritic marker. However, even roots that can be used as free morphemes cannot be written without a diacritic, there is a silent diacritic used for marking the use of a free morpheme.

As hinted to before, /h/ roots are a special case. All /h/ roots have one stroke in common, called the /h/ stroke, and it's always towards the upper left of the character. For all /h/ roots that don't begin with /hi/, these are all marker particles of different sorts ([[Old Gvar#Sentence Relators|these]] and [[Old Gvar#Forming Requests and Commands|these]]). Each of these has it's own character and does not use a diacritic. These are actually phonetic characters, built out of 3 parts each, one for the /h/ at the beginning, one for the ending consonant, and one for the vowel in the middle. But, the mostly poly-syllabic /hi/ roots ([[Old Gvar#Forming Questions|these]]) also get their own symbols. These are not phonetic, but pull from other characters that relate to the type of question being asked. They, like all other /h/ roots, don't get any diacritics put on them.
### Compound Roots
When writing [[Old Gvar#Compound Roots|compound roots]], all but the last character will be free of *any* diacritics, signaling that it is a bound morpheme, and the final character will receive the diacritic for the whole word.
## Full-Width and Half-Width Characters
Some words are not principal roots, but are still part of the principal character set
