#Kingdom #EraOfAwakening 

The [[Tshusha Pur]] kingdom was initially a pact between cities in the [[Gmir River Valley]] during the middle of the [[Era of Awakening]]. It stretched from the river valley, north along the eastern coast, across the northern coast, all the way to the [[Kwin Gulf]] in the northwest corner of the [[Eastern Continent]], where it's capitol was founded and the pact turned into a union-type kingdom.

# Formation

The [[Gmir River Valley Pact]] was a pact formed among some cities in the [[Gmir River Valley]], all agreeing to trade fairly and protect each other. This pact stretched north along the eastern coast of the [[Eastern Continent]], many cities joining in. Because of a lack of regulation and control for which cities could join, the pact spread quickly up the eastern coast and across the north to the [[Kwin Gulf]]. With the massive size of the pact, it started to lose its meaning and collapse. There was a push by many of the northwestern cities for a more organized pact: a union. With much work drafting a document that would act as a constitution, then many generations spreading the newly found kingdom back east from the [[Kwin Gulf]], then south, following the reverse path that the pact took, nearly all of the cities that were part of the pact became part of the kingdom of the [[Tshusha Pur]]. This was only possible because of a series of skilled and dedicated leaders and advancements in 

The new kingdom started to expand south along it's entire northern area. With the expansion of the kingdom came the language of [[Old Gvar]] being standard across the many cities. The kingdom tried to settle cities inland more, but the harsh [[Highland Desert]] and pushback from the [[Tanipyuf]] prevented this. That didn't stop raids, however, and the [[Tanipyuf]] dwindled.
