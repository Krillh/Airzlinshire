**Document No.**: IR-100-00-01

**Subject**: Government Document Classification Levels

This document outlines the classification levels for official government documents in the Kingdom of Monus. Each level represents a different degree of sensitivity and access restriction.

**Classification Level 5: PUBLIC** Class 5 information is open to the public and may be freely accessed by anyone in the Monus Public Archives. Documents with no specified classification are class 5.

**Classification Level 4: QUIET** Class 4 information is not in public records, but is not heavily monitored. It is available to all government employees who work on site. Minor class 4 information leaks go by a 2 strike system. The first time, it is on your record; then the second time, you will be punished. Class 4 information will be suppressed and those found to leak it will be immediately punished if it is found in the media.

**Classification Level 3: INTERNAL** Class 3 information is available to those within a certain department, or group of departments. An information leak to another department is punished by the 2 strike system, while information leaks out of the government are punished.

**Classification Level 2: SECURE** Class 2 information is secure information that belongs to a department. Each department can have its own protocol for information access and punishment. This is because each department requires differing levels of security.

**Classification Level 1: VERY SECURE** Class 1 information can only be accessed by special permission from an official from the Information Regulation Department.

**Classification Level 0: CRITICAL** Class 0 information is only available to a very small group of people, and access can only be granted by the Ruler or their Second in Command. This information is top secret.

This classification system is designed to protect the Kingdom of Monus’s sensitive information and ensure it is handled appropriately. All government employees are expected to adhere to these guidelines to maintain the integrity and security of our kingdom’s information.
