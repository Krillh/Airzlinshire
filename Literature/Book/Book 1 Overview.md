## Goals:
- **Themes:**
	- The primary theme is that everyone has shared struggles, no matter where you come from or where you're going. Everyone is a living person at the end of the day.
- I want the book to have a character that isn't someone extraordinary among the ordinary, or someone completely ordinary among the extraordinary. I want someone ordinary among the ordinary.
- This book is not one that I wish to profit from, but an exercise in interesting writing for myself.

## General Plot Idea:

The story separately follows 2 protagonists, Nolu and Dyuvil. They both lived in port towns on the [[Kwin Gulf]], near where Kmon City Kfin Dir is. However, they lived during very different eras.

See: [[Character Dyuvil]], [[Character Nolu]].
