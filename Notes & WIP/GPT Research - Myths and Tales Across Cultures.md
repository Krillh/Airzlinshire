## 1. Greek Mythology

Ancient Greek mythology is a foundational source for Western literary and cultural traditions. It encompasses a vast pantheon led by Zeus, myths of heroes like Heracles and Odysseus, and moral lessons conveyed through tragic tales. Greek myths often explore human emotions, divine caprice, and the tension between fate and free will.

### 1.1 Key Themes and Tropes

Greek myths feature several recurring themes:

- **Hero’s Journey**: Heroic quests are central, as seen in the Labors of Heracles and Odysseus’s voyage home, illustrating personal growth through trials.
- **Pride and Hubris**: Many tragedies (e.g., Niobe’s fall) emphasize the dangers of overweening pride before the gods.
- **Fate vs. Free Will**: Oedipus’s story demonstrates inescapable destiny despite human efforts—highlighting the tension between divine prophecy and personal agency.
- **Underworld Journeys**: Myths like Orpheus and Eurydice depict heroic descents to the realm of the dead, reflecting beliefs about life after death and the power of love.

### 1.2 Cultural Impact and Evolution

Greek myths informed ancient religious rituals and civic identity in city-states like Athens. Over centuries, they influenced Roman religion, Renaissance art, and modern storytelling. Key literary works such as Homer’s _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ established narrative frameworks that persist in contemporary hero narratives.

## 2. Norse Mythology

Norse myths originate from the oral traditions of the Germanic peoples of Scandinavia, crystallized in the _Poetic Edda_ and _Prose Edda_ (8th–13th centuries CE). Characterized by a pantheon of Æsir and Vanir gods, Norse cosmology emphasizes the interplay of order and chaos, culminating in Ragnarok—the apocalyptic end and rebirth of the world.

### 2.1 Symbols and Themes

Norse mythology features prominent symbols and tropes:

- **Yggdrasil**: The World Tree connecting nine realms, symbolizing cosmic order, cyclical time, and renewal after Ragnarok.
- **Mjölnir (Thor’s Hammer)**: Emblem of protection and fertility, worn as amulets even after Christianization to assert cultural continuity and resistance.
- **Valknut**: Three interlocking triangles associated with Odin and slain warriors welcomed in Valhalla—representing death, fate, and the warrior ethos.
- **Trickster and Mischief**: Loki embodies ambivalence, catalyzing key events such as the death of Baldr and the onset of Ragnarok, illustrating liminality and transformation.

### 2.2 Cultural Practices and Syncretism

Norse religious rituals included sacrifices, festivals like Yule, and the worship of local land spirits. With the spread of Christianity (8th–12th centuries CE), many symbols—especially the hammer of Thor—were syncretized with Christian crosses, reflecting cultural adaptation and religious compromise.

## 3. Ancient Egyptian Mythology

Egyptian mythology comprises an extensive set of beliefs focused on creation, the afterlife, and moral order. Principal texts include the _Pyramid Texts_, _Coffin Texts_, and the _Book of the Dead_. Central to these myths is the cyclical journey of the sun god and the concept of Ma’at—cosmic balance and justice.

### 3.1 Creation and Deities

- **Atum**: The self-created primordial god who birthed the first divine couple, Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture), from the primeval waters (Nu)—symbolizing completion and the cycle of creation and dissolution.

- **Isis and Osiris**: Myths of death and rebirth (e.g., Osiris’s murder and resurrection) emphasize regenerative cycles, underpinning funerary practices and beliefs in eternal life.

### 3.2 Afterlife and Underworld

The Duat, Egypt’s underworld, is depicted as a realm of trials where the deceased’s heart is weighed against a feather of Ma’at by Anubis. Successful souls proceed to Aaru (the Field of Reeds). Magical spells ensured safe passage and moral purity for the journey beyond death.

### 3.3 Syncretism and Cultural Evolution

In the Ptolemaic era, Greek and Egyptian deities merged (e.g., Serapis, Hermanubis), reflecting Hellenistic policies of cultural integration. This syncretism facilitated political cohesion and the survival of ancient worship practices under changing regimes.

## 4. Hindu Mythology

Hindu mythology presents a vast tapestry of texts, including the Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and epics like the _Mahabharata_ and _Ramayana_.

### 4.1 Creation Myths and Avatars

The monomyth or Hero’s Journey appears in disparate traditions, outlining departure, initiation, and return. Examples include Heracles, Rama, Odysseus, and Māui.
