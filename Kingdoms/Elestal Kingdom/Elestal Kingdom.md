The Elestal Kingdom is a secluded kingdom far to the north. It sits on the [[Elestian Continent]], one covered in ice. The Elestian people are known for their fierce protection of their land. Nobody has ever even come close to conquering them. As such, they have the oldest unchanged culture of any kingdom in recorded history. They are also the only kingdom to have it's own widely spoken language, [[Elestias]].
