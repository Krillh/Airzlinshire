# What is it?
Majel is the written language of the world of Airzlinshire. It differs from the spoken language considerably. Much like how Latin was the written language over much of Europe for a long time, even as many of the other languages were spoken by the common people. Nobody really spoke Latin in their day-to-day. Similarly, nobody really speaks Majel in their day-to-day, but it is the written language, and has developed like one (not changed very much).

Majel, for a very long time, has had no sound changes to speak of (pun intended). It also has remained fast in it's grammar, and the letter forms have not changed much at all. There have been a lot of changes since the very little documented Old Majel, though.
