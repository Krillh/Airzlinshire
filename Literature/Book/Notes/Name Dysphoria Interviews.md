## Seyla:

It’s hard for me to put into words, a lot of the dysphoria comes from weird primal feelings from deep within, the typical you are trans feelings that nobody has an explanation for. But a lot of it, especially as I further along my social transition, comes from the association each name now has. My old name was the old boy me and frankly very depressed me, Seyla marked a new beginning where I felt like I was actually getting somewhere with my life. Hearing someone call me deadname is just a reminder that I’m not a girl and people don’t see me that way, hearing my real name is the opposite and makes me feel happy and supported
