In the time of yore, upon a great flat rock, stood a fort, the genesis of what would become the First Kingdom. A mere 25 souls called this place home, divided into three distinct groups: the leader, the leader’s assistants, and the common folk. The leader, a being of immense majik power, was said to have formed the fort from the rock with but a flick of their wrist.

The leader’s assistants, six in number, were the most powerful beings after the leader. As the population grew, the need for housing became apparent. The people, in their admiration for the leader, built houses around the fort, while the leader and the assistants resided within the fort.

However, as time passed, the fort became crowded with the assistants. The leader instructed them to build more houses, but instead, they commanded the people to construct new dwellings and seized the houses closest to the fort, evicting the rightful inhabitants. Unbeknownst to the leader, a new class system had emerged: the rulers, the nobles (formerly the assistants), and the commoners.

Even when the population was a mere 250, class divide was evident. The nobles erected a wall around the fort and the houses, too many for their number, and expelled the commoners, rendering them homeless. The commoners, bereft of their homes, were forced to construct new dwellings outside the walls. They dared not retaliate, for the nobles possessed far greater majik power.

The nobles, with their combined power surpassing even that of the ruler’s family, assumed control of the kingdom. They formed a government, elected a new ruler, and reduced the ruling family to mere figureheads for the commoners, a facade to conceal their clandestine governance. This charade persisted for many years, with the commoners kept impoverished and weak by the nobles, and the ruling family held captive by the nobles’ whims.

In this era of oppression, the commoners were burdened with exorbitant taxes, subjected to a biased court, and received nothing in return from the nobles. Despite their plight, they knew they could not rebel, for they lacked the majik power to resist the nobles.

However, hope dawned when the ruler sent their eldest child, under the guise of death, to teach the commoners majik. Over four years, the commoners learned to harness their majik power and were taught to read and write, not in the traditional abugida script, but in an alphabet, enabling them to communicate covertly.

After four years of preparation, the commoners launched a surprise attack, forcing the nobles to surrender and reinstating the rulers to their rightful place. The ruler reigned for several years until the kingdom became too vast. The ruler then divided the people into seven groups, instructing each to establish a new kingdom. Using all their majik power, the ruler transported each group to a different part of the world, a feat that cost them their life.

Thus, the seven kingdoms were born, a testament to the legacy of the First Kingdom.
