**Regarding the Recent Unlawful Intrusion into the Sacred Tome Temples**

In the light of the recent events that have transpired, the Kingdom of Monus, in conjunction with the esteemed Order of the Tome Monks, wishes to address the populace regarding the unlawful intrusion into the sacred Tome Temples.

Firstly, we wish to assure our citizens that the sanctity and security of our Tome Temples remain uncompromised. The perpetrators, whose identities remain unknown, were swiftly and decisively dealt with by our vigilant Tome Monks. Their audacious attempt to steal the sacred secrets of tome-making was thwarted, demonstrating the formidable might and unwavering resolve of our Tome Monks.

We understand that there has been a temporary dip in the export of tomes, a decrease of approximately 27%. This was a necessary measure to ensure the thorough investigation and reinforcement of our security protocols. We are pleased to report that the production and export of tomes have been steadily recovering over the past three weeks.

We acknowledge the skepticism that has arisen due to the lack of independent reports on the incident. However, we must emphasize that the secrecy of the Tome Temples is paramount to the preservation of our kingdom's prosperity. The absence of external reports is not an attempt to obscure the truth, but a necessary measure to protect our sacred craft.

The Royal Government of Monus and the Order of the Tome Monks remain committed to the safety, prosperity, and well-being of our citizens. We will continue to be transparent about the abilities and powers of our tomes while safeguarding the secrets of their creation.

Let this incident serve as a stern warning to those who dare to threaten our kingdom and its sacred traditions. The Royal Government of Monus and the Order of the Tome Monks stand resolute in the face of such threats, and any attempts against us will be met with swift and decisive action.

**Signed**
