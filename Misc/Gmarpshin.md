Gmarpshin (literally: circle/cycle way) is a culture that places heavy emphasis on circles and cycles.
## Central Belief(s)
Gmarpshin has a few core, central beliefs.

1. Life is based on cycles. Everything cycles and cycles are circles. However, not all cycles are infinite. finite cycles are helices (that can look like spirals or spring shapes in 2D).
2. Respect is shown through familiarity, not formality.
### Circles and Helices
The circle represents an infinite (or appearing to be infinite) cycle, like day and night, while cycles that have a finite start and end are represented with helices. This distinction is important to these people. They always make sure to consider which cycles have an end and which do not. As a result, both circles and helices are sacred shapes.

Circles are most often associated with higher powers, deities, or nature. These things appear to be unending and stable.

Helices are associated with mortals things; things that are finite and possibly unstable in comparison with circular cycles.
