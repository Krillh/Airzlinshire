## Central Belief(s)
Life is based on cycles. Everything cycles and cycles are circles. However, not all cycles are infinite. finite cycles are helices (that can look like spirals or spring shapes in 2D though).
### Circles and Helices
The circle represents an infinite (or appearing to be infinite) cycle, like day and night, while cycles that have a finite start and end are represented with helices. This distinction is important to these people. They always make sure to consider which cycles have an end and which do not.
