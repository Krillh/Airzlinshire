## Introduction
The Drazdun Institute of Majik Research (DIMR) has been investigating the origins of majik, focusing on the hypothesis that majik can be extracted from the air under high pressure. This research is inspired by the phenomenon known as the Colored Mist observed at the tops of the Monus Mountains, where majik condenses into a mist when it gets cold enough. The current working theory suggests that we are surrounded by gaseous majik, which could potentially be harnessed or used to power majik manipulations.
## Objectives
1. To design and construct a machine capable of compressing air to unprecedented levels.
2. To test the hypothesis that majik can be extracted from the air under high pressure.
3. To observe and document any physical manifestations of majik during the compression process.
## Methodology
### Equipment and Materials
- Compression machine
- Various container shapes and materials
- Ice for cooling
- Pressure-tight valve
- Cylindrical container (radius: 0.4 meters, length: 2.4 meters)
- 100:1 gear ratio mechanism
### Procedure
1. **Initial Setup**: The team constructed a machine to compress air, starting with various container shapes and materials. The containers were cooled to 2°C using ice.
2. **Pressure Testing**: The team gradually increased the pressure within the containers, recording the maximum pressure achieved before the containers failed.
3. **Material Improvement**: A new material was introduced to construct a cylindrical container, which was tested for its ability to withstand higher pressures.
4. **Observation**: A pressure-tight valve was added to the container to test for liquid production. The valve was released slightly to observe any escaping liquid and its effects.
## Results
### Week 1
- **Pressure Achieved**: 5.93 atm
- **Observations**: Containers failed at this pressure. Cooling was maintained at 2°C.
### Week 2
- **Pressure Achieved**: 6.78 atm
- **Observations**: The new cylindrical container with one layer of the new material showed improved performance but still failed.
### Week 3
- **Pressure Achieved**: 12 atm
- **Observations**: The cylindrical container with two layers of the new material successfully withstood the pressure. Upon releasing the valve, a sound indicating escaping liquid was heard, and steam was observed. The scientists reported a spike in their majik energy, suggesting the presence of liquid majik.
## Discussion
The experiment demonstrated that under high pressure and low temperature, it is possible to extract a liquid form of majik from the air. The observations of steam and the reported spike in majik energy provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis. However, further research is needed to determine the exact nature and properties of the liquid majik.
## Conclusion
The DIMR team’s experiment has provided significant insights into the origins of majik and its potential extraction from the air. The successful compression of air to 12 atm and the subsequent observations suggest that majik can indeed be condensed into a liquid form. This research lays the groundwork for future studies on harnessing and utilizing majik.
## Future Work
1. **Material Enhancement**: Further improvements in container materials to withstand even higher pressures.
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of the liquid majik to understand its properties and potential applications.
3. **Extended Observations**: Long-term observations to study the stability and behavior of liquid majik under various conditions.
