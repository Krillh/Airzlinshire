Welcome to **Airzlinshire**, a meticulously crafted fantasy world teeming with its own unique people, geography, flora, fauna, languages, kingdoms, history, social norms, magic, money, sciences, and much more. 
## Our Vision:
Airzlinshire is not just a fantasy world; it's an immersive experience that doesn't hand-wave at details. It's a realm that feels complete and congruent, offering endless opportunities for exploration and discovery.
## Our Mission:
We aim to create a space where creativity flourishes. Airzlinshire began in 2019 as a creative outlet and has since evolved into a collaborative project. We want our contributors to learn and grow, just like how the creation of the world's language, Majel, exposed me to the world of linguistics and conlanging.
## Our Goal:
Our end goal is to create a masterpiece akin to a sculpture, an art piece that is a testament to creativity. We want our contributors to take pride in their creations and for people to appreciate the art of world building.
## Our Approach:
The journey is just as important as the destination. We want the creation process to be a safe space for creativity, where ideas are welcomed and nurtured. We believe in stress-free collaboration, driven by passion, not deadlines. We are committed to maintaining a positive environment, and any toxicity will not be tolerated.
## Our Team:
We value quality over quantity. As such, we are selective in choosing our contributors. We are currently seeking a small, dedicated team who align with our vision and mission. As we grow and learn, we may expand our team.
## Join Us:
If you're interested in contributing to Airzlinshire, we'd love to hear from you. Let's create something extraordinary together.
# The Journey
Hi, my name is Kirill. Airzlinshire is a passion project of mine that started roughly in 2019. It is a fantasy world made from scratch that I started because I wanted to have a world that was well sculpted and to be a better place than the real world. Also because I needed somewhere to dump all my creativity. For a long time it was just me, working on this little (not anymore) world. Inventing everything from scratch, the [[people]], magic ([[Majik]]), [[geography]], [[Majel|language]], [[money]], [[flora]], [[fauna]], and much more. All of it attempting to improve on life.

Sometime in 2022, I thought about what the point of making the world was. I was stumped. I warily decided that I would publish it as writing material, letting authors use it as inspiration. But, then i thought about how it was a passion project after all, and didn't need a reason. But then I invited a friend who was just as passionate about it as I was to help me make it. His name is Clel. He suggested writing a book, and I wasn't too keen on the idea at first because I wasn't confident in my writing skills and I wasn't sure if that's what i wanted the project to be: just a book. Despite this, I figured it would only help the world, attempting to write a book would act as a sort of devil's advocate and would show us all the things that needed thinking about. After all, coming up with a whole world from scratch is no small task and we were bound to miss things. Either way, the idea of actually writing a book grew on me ([[Book 1]]). Now, we were coming up with characters and timelines and all that jazz.

After a while of occasionally coming back to work on this project in snippets, I decided something very large in 2024. I decided to expand the project, turn it into something much much bigger. The book being written on the back burners of our school life would be one part of a much larger project rather than the main content. I wanted to go big, not go home. With the idea of a world in my head, and the vision for this world that I like to call a sculpture, I set out looking for people to help. This new scale made me realize that there was no way I could do it on my own.
