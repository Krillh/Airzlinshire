## What is a Tome?  
Tomes are a powerful way for someone to use Majik that they normally wouldn't be able to. They often come in the form of certain cut stones, but not necessarily. They also come in many different sizes and power levels, and range from mildly expensive to some of the most valuable relics in history. Essentially, a tome is a container with a set of Majik procedures preset into it, this is known as a [[Spells|Spell]]. This container also has some amount of Majik energy stored within it that it uses to execute, or cast, the preset procedures. This does mean that anyone can cast a tome's spell if it has sufficient charge, even if the spell requires Majik energy elements that they don't have enough, or any, affiliation with if they wanted to do the same thing themselves.

Before diving into tomes, it's important to mention something. The specifics of how tomes work and how they're made is a heavily guarded secret of the Monus Tome Monks. Everything in this document is unclassified information that is open to the public people of Airzlinshire. But, it is inherently incomplete.
## Tome Classification
Tomes are classified in multiple ways. This is useful when pricing and buying tomes. They are most commonly measured by their power (PW), capacity (CP). They are also measured by their majik efficiency (ME), size efficiency (SE), casting time (CT), and spell complexity (SC). These other measurements are not typically something the average person dabbles in. They are the nerdy stats.

The specifics of tome classification and measurement are open knowledge as a form of checks on Monus to reduce the chance of Monus overpricing the tomes, obfuscating the truth, or lying outright. Methods have been made to confirm the measurements of a tome and are available to merchants at relatively low prices. Furthermore, when buying a tome, you can see all of the measurements and classifications on a data sheet. The material and time taken to produce it is also included with the data sheet.

Typically, when buying a tome, the power index and the capacity are what you look for and are often most clearly labeled. One could ask to look at the "mid-power tomes" in a store for example, or look for a certain amount of uses.
### Tome Power (PW)
Tomes are categorized by power based on their calculated power index. This classification and categorization of power is based on the amount of Majik energy used in each casting. The named classification categories are adjusted periodically to keep up with the times, but the power index is calculated mathematically, and doesn't change. To calculate the PW of a tome, you simply add the majik power of each element used in each cast measured in gako.
### Tome Capacity (CP)
The capacity of a tome is very simple, it is the expected number of uses at it's full charge capacity. This is calculated by dividing the actual total majik capacity, measured in gako, by the power used in each casting, also measured in gako. The number must, by law, contain only 2 significant digits rounded *down*. For example: 1493.42 calculated uses would have to be displayed as 1400 uses.
### Tome Majik Efficiency (ME)
The majik efficiency is a measure of how much majik is used to cast the spell and how much is lost in each casting. The same way a person can be more or less efficient (see: [[Majik# Casting Skill]]). Though, tomes tend to be much less efficient than people are. This is because of how they are made *(CLASSIFIED)*.
### Tome Size Efficiency (SE)
The size efficiency of a tome is just the density of the majik when the tome is fully charged, measured in diako.
### Tome Casting Time (CT)
The casting time is the amount of time it takes for a tome to expend a full cast's worth of energy. The time it takes is usually quite small unless you have very high power tomes. It's calculated by dividing the majik power of a cast, measured in gako, by the majik flow rate of the tome, measured in seko. The majik flow rate is dependent on both the material the tome is made of and classified factors of the manufacturing process.
### Tome Spell Complexity (SP)
The spell complexity of a tome is one of the more, ironically, complex measurements. It is calculated by multiplying together one more than the square root of the majik power for each element. Along with being the most complicated to calculate, it is also the least used measurement. Monus insists that it is useful, and claims that it is used internally, but refuses to share what for.
## Uses for Tomes  
Tomes are used for all sorts of purposes, including as weapons, for transportation as engines, as portable light sources, to accelerate crop growth, and much, much more. Anything that can be achieved by use of Majik can be achieved with a tome.
