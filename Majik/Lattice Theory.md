Lattice Theory is a theory of life that describes life in terms of majik manipulations and Majik Lattices.

In Lattice Theory, a Majik Lattice is a collection of string, or thread, shaped pieces of ethyr that wrap and weave around each other that can cause certain Majik Manipulations when agitated by Majik energy. The specific manipulation caused depends on the nature of the contact point. The energy travels through the *threads* and is released at these connections, called *knots*.

## Threads
A thread is a piece of ethyr that resembles a thread shape. It is what wraps around other threads to make *knots*. Majik energy travels through threads to different parts of a lattice. Threads can be made of different wavelengths of ethyr. Different wavelengths will . With use, threads will degrade, and . Threads with more tension will degrade slower
