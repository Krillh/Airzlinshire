#Kingdom #EraOfAwakening 

The [[Tshusha Pur]] kingdom was formed slowly as a pact between cities in the [[Gmir River Valley]] during the middle of the [[Era of Awakening]]. It stretched from the river valley, north along the eastern coast, across the northern coast, all the way to the [[Kwin Gulf]] in the northwest corner of the [[Eastern Continent]], where it's capitol was founded and the pact turned into a kingdom. The new kingdom started to expand south along it's entire northern area. With the expansion of the kingdom came the language of [[Old Gvar]] being standard across the many cities. The kingdom tried to settle cities inland more, but the harsh [[Highland Desert]] and pushback from the [[Tanipyuf]] prevented this. That didn't stop raids, however, and the [[Tanipyuf]] dwindled.
