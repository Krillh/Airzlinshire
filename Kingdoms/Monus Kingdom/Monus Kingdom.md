The Monus Kingdom is the smallest kingdom of the 7 by land. But are the 4th most populous.

# Culture
The Monus culture is one of quietness and respect. There is a strict social hierarchy a large wealth gap. Someone of lower status is easy to pick out from their clothes, and they must pay respects to those of higher status. Blues and purples are important colors, and swirls are considered the most beautiful shape.
## Wealth & Power Gap
In Monus, there is an extremely large wealth and power gap. The lowest class makes up about 68% of the population. They are all the working class and live in poor, but livable conditions. They get to enjoy comforts like markets, entertainment, sturdy housing, warmth, and enough money to make it by without starving. Water is also a free commodity, offered at various wells in towns. Most houses have packed dirt flooring, and beds are raised and made of a scratchy, but fluffy material that is harvested from a specific species of bush. Overall, this working class is not a terrible state of being, but is so incredibly different from the life of even the next highest class.

The next class, tome merchants, make up nearly 13% of the population. They often don't have much in terms of real estate in the actual borders of Monus, maybe only a High House. They usually live primarily near their sale location of choice. Many live in [[Solus Kingdom|Solus]] as Solus is the largest importer of tomes. For a most merchants, selling takes much more time, as most don't sell to another distributer. Specifically when selling to Solus. The Solus Kingdom has very specific laws on the importing of goods.
# Industry
