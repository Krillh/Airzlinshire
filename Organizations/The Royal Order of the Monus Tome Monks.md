# Who are the Monus Tome Monks?
The Royal Order of the Tome Monks is a partner organization of theÂ [[Monus Kingdom]]. The order does not work under the kingdom, despite being called "royal", but works with it in partnership. They however do have a very close partnership, and take action with the best interest of the other organization in mind.

The Order is comprised of monks and their purpose is to make [[Tomes]] for the [[Monus Kingdom]]. Monus' power comes from the making of tomes, and being the only kingdom that can make them. The process of fabricating tomes is a heavily guarded secret by the Order. Tomes are an extremely [[Monus Kingdom#Exports|important industry]] for Monus.
