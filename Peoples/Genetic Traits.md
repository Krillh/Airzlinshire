#Peoples 

There are multiple different types of genetic traits that [[Peoples|people]] can have
## Species Trait
A species trait is a trait that is inherent to the species of that person. These can be physical, like how [[Giants|giants]] are usually tall, but can also be mental, like how [[Mozbiin|warriors]] often have shorter tempers.
### Species Trait Transfer
When 2 different species [[Reproduction|reproduce]], there is a chance that one or more species traits of the non-host parent will show up in the child as a mono-generational trait.
## Mono-Generational Trait
A mono-generational trait is a genetic trait that has almost zero chance of appearing in a person's child, as a host or non-host.
## Standard Trait
A standard trait is any genetic trait that has a significant chance to be passed on to a child in [[Reproduction|reproduction]].
