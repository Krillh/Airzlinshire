Moral Development (lawrence kohlberg)

- **Infant (0-2 years) - Sensorimotor Stage:**
    
    - Recognizing familiar faces 
    - Object permanence (understanding an object still exists even when hidden) 
    - Imitating actions 
    - Simple cause-and-effect understanding
    - army crawl
    - pulling up
    - walking (10mo - 16 mo)
    
- **Early Childhood (2-7 years) - Preoperational Stage:**
    
    - Symbolic play (pretend play)!!
    - Language development
    - Egocentrism (difficulty seeing other perspectives) 
    - Classification (grouping objects by similar features) 
    - fine motor skills
    - writing
    - tying, etc
    
- **Middle Childhood (7-11 years) - Concrete Operational Stage:**
    
    - Conservation (understanding quantity remains constant despite changes in appearance) 
    - Seriation (ordering objects by size) 
    - Logical reasoning with concrete situations 
    - perspective taking
    - beginning developing real relationships
    - Understanding of simple rules and concepts 
    - has unique thoughts, you are individual. part of perspective
    - desire of independence, but not knowing the dangers
    - individuation: develop interests
    - developing more emotional control (shame)
    
- **Adolescence (12+ years) - Formal Operational Stage:**
    
    - Abstract reasoning and situations
    - Hypothetical thinking 
    - Complex problem-solving (more than 1 solution)
    - Understanding of multiple perspectives 
    - moral issues, politics
    - deductive logic
    - much more individualization
    - developing deeper relationships, some emotional relationships
    

Important Points to Remember:

- These are general guidelines, and individual development can vary.
- Milestones are not always achieved in a strict order.
- Early intervention can be crucial for addressing developmental delays.

## Notes

- 0-2 years - all learning is tactile. sucking, tasting, seeing actions, object permanence. learns causality (that you can cause things to happen). staring, copying.

Autism can be diagnosed at 2+ because they don't show as much observation.

startling to loud noises

most humans are selfish until a certain age, don't understand perspective taking
