Chapter 1 comparisons:
- The Dust / The Flood. Both's got towns destroyed by something
- the need to eat and drink to survive
## Chapter 1 Part 1 (Nolu)

The sands stretch endlessly on to the suns' ends and the stars' beginning. One lonely pair of boots fall heavy onto the burrowing beetle's drowned carcass that is the Bzor Trail: once a well-traveled route, now quiet. The sand, when compared with The Dust, is a good mother. It loves tough, but always with a feeding hand for those willing to find it. A distant wind reminds the world of its might with a ripping sand-filled howl, but the cave pays no mind. It has seen ten thousand years of The Dust; it has become only what little is callous enough to endure the end of the world. The town was not so lucky.

Grateful for the cave's protection, the fire burns with an unchecked rage. Just a bit too much deklan. What a waste. The deklan burns off, leaving only some bone-dry branches. They burn fast and hot under a quickly charring skewered diblin. A small catch, hopefully enough to feed another lonely day of walking: a catch like this is a blessing out here. One of the many hungry mouths of the desert will eat tonight, filled with gratitude and a not quite full but satisfied stomach.
