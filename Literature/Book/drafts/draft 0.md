Chapter 1 comparisons:
- The Dust / The Flood. Both's got towns destroyed by something
- the need to eat and drink to survive
## Chapter 1 Part 1 (Nolu)

The sands stretch endlessly on to the suns' ends and the stars' beginning. One lonely pair of boots fall heavy onto the burrowing beetle's drowned carcass that is the Bzor Trail: once a well-traveled route, now quiet. The sand, when compared with The Dust, is a good mother. It loves tough, but always with a feeding hand for those willing to find it. A distant wind reminds the world of its might with a ripping sand-filled howl, but the cave pays no mind. It has seen ten thousand years of The Dust; it has become only what little is callous enough to endure the end of the world. The town was not so lucky.

Grateful for the cave's protection, the fire burns with an unchecked rage. Just a bit too much deklan; what a waste. The deklan burns off, leaving only some bone-dry branches. They burn fast and hot under a quickly charring skewered diblin. A good catch, hopefully enough to feed another lonely day of walking: a catch like this is a blessing out here. One of the many hungry mouths of the desert will eat tonight, filled with gratitude and a not quite full but satisfied stomach.

The wind helplessly pounds on the cave again, screaming to be let in and destroy the unwanted visitor of the desert. The night winds are always ruthless, hungry beasts. As the dry branches wither away to coals, then only to hot ash, the another sound boldly makes its way into the cave: the steady breath of slumber. A tired, weary face finds itself uncovered from its mask in the darkness.

I dream of nothing.

## Chapter 1 Part 2 (Dyuvil)

I awake with a start, jolted awake by the world-shattering boom of thunder. For a moment, I'm in my little room back in Kmon (village), awoken by a Kwin (Gulf) thunderstorm. Upon returning senses and that all too familiar pain in my gut, I'm reminded that those comforts are long gone. There's a light knock. With a grunt I pull myself up, letting my stiffness distract me from that stabbing in my gut.

"Yes?" I manage to say with more confidence than I felt. The door opens and a shaggy-dressed person steps just inside and stands with a respectful pose. They seem to be Min Vigin. *Do I have a Min Vigin on my staff?* Acutely aware of my messy look and their troubled look, I wait for them to speak.

"I carry troubling news." Their voice is tinted with that Northern Central Continent lisp, but otherwise familiar Kwisha. "The elders of Dir refuse to see you."

"I see." My mind begins assessing options, logic acting as a weighted blanket on that little panic that's fighting to rise up. I scrub my face and comb my fingers through my hair, putting a small dent in the number of its knots. "I can't have another city secede. Tell them...," I hesitate, "Tell the elders that they *will* attend a meeting. Their fields depend on it." As they nod and start to leave, I stop them. Before I think better of it, I say, "What's your name? I don't recognize you as part of my staff." A for a brief moment, hurt flashes over their face, and regret washes over me.

"Tal Zlun," they say simply and leave before I can say voice the apology forming on my tongue. I stand there for a moment, wishing that Zlun would come back and just be angry at me. I shake those thoughts from my head. I don't have time for those, I don't have time for any of that. I need to eat something and get my day started. As if on cue, my stomach growls. Stepping out into the beating sunlight and endless ocean of sand, I turn back to the temporary house that just last night shielded me from the might of the desert's night winds. The structure already earned a worn appearance in just one night of sandy pelting. I think back to last night, laying on that cot, listening to the wail of the wind defending its territory, trying to rid its land of intruders.

As I walk across the squeaky sand to the cookhouse, my hunters inform me that there was little catch this morning with more apology than I thought was necessary. I reassure them that sometimes turnout is just low, but my mind is already on getting my morning meal. The cooks greet me as jolly as always, giving me a full portion of stew.

"I thought the catch was low this morning."

"Oh yes, but you of all people should *always* eat enough!" Their tone tells me that there will be no arguing. My stomach is thankful after all, even when those around me get their morning meals of notably lesser amounts. I eat in my room, dreading the day ahead.

Suddenly I'm awake, coughing. My mouth is full of something. I cough, each breath in is a painful dry wheeze. I can't think of anything but trying to breathe. My mouth
