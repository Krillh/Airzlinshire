## Abstract
The Drazdun Institute of Military Majik (DIMM) has developed a smaller and more cost-effective version of the Drazdun Institute of Majik Research (DIMR)‘s machine to produce liquid majik. This machine can be deployed at military bases to replenish soldiers’ majik energy quickly. This paper details the design, testing, and deployment of these machines.
## Introduction
The DIMR’s research on compressing air to extract majik has led to the development of a machine capable of producing liquid majik. Building on this research, the DIMM aimed to create a smaller, cheaper version suitable for military use.
## Methodology
- **Design**: A tome-powered motor with a gear ratio on a piston to compress air was found to be the most cost-effective option. An air inlet valve was added to ensure fresh air intake.
- **Testing**: Repeated compressions without new air did not produce majik replenishing effects or liquid majik. The volume of air remained nearly the same, suggesting that majik, if a gas, is extremely sparse.
## Results
- **Majik Replenishment**: When liquid majik is released into the faces of soldiers low on majik energy, it replenishes their supply quickly.
- **Safety**: Current testing shows no adverse effects other than a spike in majik energy. The machine is declared safe for use, with overuse effects still under study.
## Deployment
- **Production**: 12 machines were produced.
- **Deployment**:
    - 4 machines to military outposts
    - 3 machines to military training sites
    - 5 machines to military testing facilities
- **Operation**: Each machine is operated by a specialist who also trains others on its use and expected effects.
## Conclusion
The DIMM’s liquid majik machines provide a quick and safe method to replenish soldiers’ majik energy. Further studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of repeated use.
